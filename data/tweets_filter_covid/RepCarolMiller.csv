RepCarolMiller,1095786873627258880,2019-02-13 20:48:44,"I am so excited about this plan between Apple and Dept. of VA. Our veterans put everything on the line for our country and it is our duty to take care of them back home. This will make healthcare so much easier for the 140,000 veterans in the 3rd district!
