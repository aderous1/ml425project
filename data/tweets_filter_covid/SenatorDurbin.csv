So today, the Trump Admin. announces that it will cut off federal funding to operate #COVID19 testing sites in Illinois &amp; 4 other states. This decision defies common sense. https://t.co/u1AR8eoj7o"
SenatorDurbin,1275900310469390336,2020-06-24 21:15:13,"For the 2nd week in a row, Senate Republicans have confirmed a Circuit Court nominee with a record of hostility toward the ACA. Even during one of the greatest public health crises in our nation’s history, Republicans just won’t let go of their obsession with attacking Obamacare."
