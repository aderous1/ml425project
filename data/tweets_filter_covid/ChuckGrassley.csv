ChuckGrassley,1318974483324088325,2020-10-21 17:56:36,Democrats put politics above ppl by blocking virus relief bill again 2day this bill had $$$ for schools/testing/tracing/vaccine/small biz We hear Democrats say we shouldn’t do SCOTUS to focus on the virus but we vote &amp; Democrats block us It’s clear Dems don’t want a solution

ChuckGrassley,1315728088685256704,2020-10-12 18:56:36,We could pass targeted relief for families &amp; schools 2day if Dems would let us Everyone knows we can work on 2 things at once so claiming SCOTUS is preventing virus relief is hogwash Democrats insisting on unnecessary items is unreasonable
