LindseyGrahamSC,1275199130848178180,2020-06-22 22:48:59,"This decision, in my view, will have a chilling effect on our economic recovery at a time we should be doing all we can to restore the economy."
LindseyGrahamSC,1275199128402870278,2020-06-22 22:48:58,"President Trump built it once and he can build it again, but not if the tools that helped create the strongest economy in generations are not available."

LindseyGrahamSC,1275199124271443975,2020-06-22 22:48:57,"The shuttering of these programs may not lead to employment opportunities for displaced American workers, but could instead increase the cost of consumer goods for Americans -- particularly service industry related products."
LindseyGrahamSC,1275199122782502915,2020-06-22 22:48:57,"Unfortunately, I fear the President’s decision today to temporarily shut down these programs will create a drag on our economic recovery."
LindseyGrahamSC,1275199120681074693,2020-06-22 22:48:57,"Before coronavirus, legal immigration and programs like these played an important role in helping President Trump create the strongest economy in generations. I have little doubt that programs like these would help him build it again."
LindseyGrahamSC,1275199119280279555,2020-06-22 22:48:56,"Work visas for temporary and seasonal jobs covering industries like hospitality, forestry, and many economic sectors can only be issued AFTER American workers have had a chance to fill the job position."

LindseyGrahamSC,1275199113261461506,2020-06-22 22:48:55,"Legal immigration is a positive for the American economy, and visa programs allowing American companies to secure qualified, legal labor throughout the world have benefitted economic growth in the United States."

LindseyGrahamSC,1273634653870702592,2020-06-18 15:12:19,"Such a concept should be employed, when it comes to police departments. If they're following best police practices, they should be immune from liability. If they fail, they should be accountable."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273634652952150016,2020-06-18 15:12:18,"The concept of standard of care has dramatically improved medicine because if a doctor meets the standard of care, they're immune from liability."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273634651916173313,2020-06-18 15:12:18,"Qualified immunity reform should have as its focus professionalizing police departments, institutionalizing best police practices when it comes to use of force, and protecting constitutional rights of American citizens."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273634650183909379,2020-06-18 15:12:18,No cop should have to worry about losing their house or their life's work because of making decisions on the job. My goal is to drive police departments and systems throughout the country to adopt the best policing practices when it comes to use of force.
LindseyGrahamSC,1273634649089150976,2020-06-18 15:12:17,"The subject of qualified immunity is often mentioned in this debate. My view is it is now time to revisit the judicial doctrine of qualified immunity, understanding that individual police officers will be immune from civil liability."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273634646971109376,2020-06-18 15:12:17,"I agree with many statements made by my Democratic and Republican colleagues that we have an historic opportunity to reform policing, to make it better and more just for all. It's time for the body to rise to the occasion, and I’m hopeful we can."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273307354415747072,2020-06-17 17:31:44,"Equally importantly, it puts billions of dollars into the system to address the national parks maintenence backlog, which has been neglected for decades."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273307352163328002,2020-06-17 17:31:44,Big bipartisan vote on the Great American Outdoors Act. This legislation expands the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to preserve pristine lands for future generations in a private sector fashion.
LindseyGrahamSC,1273280175422218243,2020-06-17 15:43:44,"On the five year anniversary, we think of those who lost their lives and the families left behind. The Christmases without loved ones. The birthdays missed. Our hearts are still broken and our prayers remain with the parishioners at Mother Emanuel."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273280173882908672,2020-06-17 15:43:44,"I know that type of grace can only come from God. Of all the things that I've seen in public life, the words from the family members continue to amaze me to this day. You must truly have the love of the Lord in your heart to be able to muster that kind of forgiveness."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273280171114729472,2020-06-17 15:43:43,"Then just days after this horrible tragedy, the people at Mother Emanuel showed a level of love and forgiveness that was truly unimaginable. It was an act that is rarely seen. I personally cannot imagine turning to the person who killed my family members saying I forgive you."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273280170246488067,2020-06-17 15:43:43,"It remains hard to understand how anyone could have so much hate in their heart. To be welcomed into a church, worship with the parishioners, and then turn around and shoot them in cold blood remains one of the most horrific acts ever recorded."
LindseyGrahamSC,1273280168510005248,2020-06-17 15:43:43,"Five years have passed and it still feels like a bad dream, but we know it actually happened. The senseless murder of nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel hit South Carolina like a ton of bricks."
