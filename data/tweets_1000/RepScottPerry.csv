RepScottPerry,1197536909876252675,2019-11-21 15:27:03,I agree with Dr. Hill regarding the Russian interference and their intent to have Americans fighting among themselves. The Russians actually did more in this regard after the 2016 elections.
RepScottPerry,1197536832331886592,2019-11-21 15:26:44,"The record is full of these instances because it’s not exclusive to Russia. There is actual evidence of Ukraine’s meddling through Democrat operative Alexandra Chalupa, but Chairman Schiff and Dr. Hill remain disinterested in that."
