SenateMajLdr,1085289991473897472,2019-01-15 21:37:52,The Democratic Leader said the Senate shouldn’t do any business during this partial government shutdown. But apparently he didn’t actually mean it. Because now the Democratic Leader would like to dictate the terms of a debate on Russia.
SenateMajLdr,1085289990140112896,2019-01-15 21:37:52,I made it our first priority to move legislation that would have helped defend Israel and Jordan and provide justice for Syrians who have been tortured and murdered by the Assad regime.

SenateMajLdr,1084911859797504000,2019-01-14 20:35:18,Enforcing our laws has not become unethical overnight. The physical barriers at the border that Democrats supported yesterday have not somehow become a radical right-wing position today. Border security still matters. American families still deserve safety.
