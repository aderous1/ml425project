RepSlotkin,1114259560246796289,2019-04-05 20:12:35,Great to join @mitchellreports to talk about the PAID AD Act and protecting our democracy.

Stopping them from doing it again shouldn’t be partisan. My new bipartisan bill would make those ads illegal: https://t.co/u5iFnTA6bF"
RepSlotkin,1113921621050441728,2019-04-04 21:49:44,Huge thanks to @RepDanKildee and @SenStabenow for their leadership on this legislation.

Proud to help introduce the VET PFAS Act today alongside my Michigan colleagues. https://t.co/dMlRUauECg"

RepSlotkin,1113577245837275136,2019-04-03 23:01:19,It was an important and powerful gesture to reaffirm that commitment today on the eve of #NATO70.
RepSlotkin,1113577245241745408,2019-04-03 23:01:19,"We’re facing emerging threats that are changing the face of warfare, and causing uncertainty. And we all know that when you face uncertainty, it is better to face it with friends who have your back."
RepSlotkin,1113577244734234626,2019-04-03 23:01:19,"As Secretary General @jensstoltenberg said, ‘The strength of a nation is not only measured by the size of its economy, or the number of its soldiers. But also by the number of its friends.'"

It's something we can’t take for granted — it is absolutely essential for our national security. @HASCDemocrats https://t.co/Oc4xT6EEba"

RepSlotkin,1113187839162880000,2019-04-02 21:13:57,"Equal pay shouldn't be a partisan issue — it's an economic issue. It's not only wrong that women earn less than men for the same work— it means that over time, women &amp; families have thousands less to invest in their education, buy a house, grow their business. #EqualPayDay"

RepSlotkin,1111297163085205504,2019-03-28 16:01:05,"Defending that action by comparing some Democrats to Nazis, as Rep. Louie Gohmert did, must also be loudly condemned."
