RepRussFulcher,1197624162115821583,2019-11-21 21:13:45,"The fact that President Trump knew about it makes him culpable. It is entirely possible that, if he didn’t bring it forward, we could be sitting through an impeachment hearing for another reason; to impeach the President because he was aware of the crime yet did nothing about it."
RepRussFulcher,1197624161276960771,2019-11-21 21:13:45,"As a result of the impeachment hearings, it is clear that while serving as VP, Joe Biden leveraged his position such that his son Hunter would be rewarded with substantial fiscal gain.

RepRussFulcher,1197624160270323717,2019-11-21 21:13:45,"At this point, their political investment is so great that to do anything less would sacrifice pride, reputation, &amp; political position. Such timing is now estimated to extend into January; because impeachment is in search of a crime &amp; more time is needed to find a crime."
RepRussFulcher,1197624159133671438,2019-11-21 21:13:44,No democrat present in the hearing changed their view due to Mr. Sondland’s testimony. No republican changed their view.

RepRussFulcher,1195043440813379585,2019-11-14 18:18:53,"Chairman Schiff’s democrat committee members agree with witnesses Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent as they cite how critical it is to respect and defend the Ukrainian borders. However, there is no evidence during this Congress that they share the same concern about American borders."
RepRussFulcher,1195043439735459841,2019-11-14 18:18:53,"Democrats also concerned that POTUS wanted to investigate Burisma Holdings. However, Dems not concerned w/ Biden threatening (video: https://t.co/h41anmeAI7) to stop $1 billion to Ukraine unless they fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma who was paying his son $50,000/month."
RepRussFulcher,1195043438674223105,2019-11-14 18:18:53,"Democrats had concerns w/ U.S. not providing enough aid to Ukraine. After the Crimea invasion (Under Obama) mostly non-lethal aid was provided to the Ukrainians. In contrast, Trump increased Ukraine’s security by allowing lethal deterrence weapons like Javelin missiles."
RepRussFulcher,1195043437491429377,2019-11-14 18:18:52,"During the hearing, Schiff also stopped a republican member from speaking when he feared the whistleblower’s identity was about to be divulged."
RepRussFulcher,1195043436300263425,2019-11-14 18:18:52,"Schiff stated for the record that he did not know the identity of the whistleblower. 
Schiff also previously claimed “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower” and this was found to be false; the whistleblower reached out to Schiff’s staff before filing their complaint."
RepRussFulcher,1195043435226505216,2019-11-14 18:18:52,"The whistleblower approached authorities without asking to have legal “whistleblower” protection. However, IG Horowitz identified the whistleblower as having bias in favor of Joe Biden, &amp; somehow legal whistleblower protections were invoked through Chairman Schiff’s committee."
RepRussFulcher,1195043434182168576,2019-11-14 18:18:52,"Mr. Taylor testified that he believed the President’s actions threatened U.S. Foreign Policy. However, Mr. Taylor did not acknowledge that the President has the right to set foreign policy, and when asked, neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Kent could identify any laws breached."
RepRussFulcher,1195043433179688962,2019-11-14 18:18:51,"Mr. Taylor said his staffer heard POTUS say something to the effect of ""he was more interested in the Burisma-Biden connection.” However, it turns out this is a retelling from a staffer who recalls overhearing EU Ambassador Sondland in a restaurant talking to POTUS on his phone.."
