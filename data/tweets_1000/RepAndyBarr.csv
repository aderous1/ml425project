RepAndyBarr,1213596940279205890,2020-01-04 23:03:52,"However, I also have the humility to acknowledge that Congress lacks the power to divest the President of his Commander-in-Chief authorities under Article II."
RepAndyBarr,1213596939251519488,2020-01-04 23:03:52,"As a Member of Congress, I believe I have a special duty to jealously guard legislative prerogatives, including the power to declare war, and to provide a check on Executive Branch overreach."
RepAndyBarr,1213596938265870348,2020-01-04 23:03:52,This was in recognition of the slow pace and inefficiency of legislative proceedings under the Articles of Confederation.
RepAndyBarr,1213596937271828480,2020-01-04 23:03:52,Don‚Äôt forget the Framers of the Constitution specifically rejected a proposal that Congress be empowered to ‚Äúmake war‚Äù and implied power for the President to ‚Äúrepel sudden attacks.‚Äù
RepAndyBarr,1213596936311332865,2020-01-04 23:03:51,"Of course, that is precisely the scenario here involving the President‚Äôs decisive defensive strike against Soleimani in response to the attack on our Embassy."
RepAndyBarr,1213596934503649282,2020-01-04 23:03:51,"Finally, according to the OLC, ‚Äúif our Armed Forces otherwise lawfully stationed in a foreign country were fired upon and defended themselves, we doubt that such engagement in hostilities would be covered by the consultation and reporting provisions of the War Powers Resolution.‚Äù"
RepAndyBarr,1213596933597650944,2020-01-04 23:03:51,"Furthermore, the War Powers Resolution applies only to the deployment of ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù bodies of military personnel, and would not apply to a drone strike."
RepAndyBarr,1213596932700020736,2020-01-04 23:03:50,"And the War Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C. 1541-48, does not limit the the President‚Äôs power to act without Congress.  At most, it merely imposes a reporting &amp; consultation requirement on the President until Congress passes a concurrent resolution to terminate the military action."
RepAndyBarr,1213596931831803904,2020-01-04 23:03:50,The courts have generally declined to review the exercise of such unilateral Executive power.

RepAndyBarr,1213596921945825281,2020-01-04 23:03:48,"But dating back to the Prize Cases in 1863, the Supreme Court has long held that the President may act without Congress to defend the nation."
RepAndyBarr,1213596920402391044,2020-01-04 23:03:48,It is true that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to declare war and the sole power of the purse to either fund or defund military action.
