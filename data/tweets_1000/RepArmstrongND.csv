RepArmstrongND,1268568195729887232,2020-06-04 15:40:01,We also need to recognize that the overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are great people who serve their communities by performing a challenging and dangerous job. Any legislation cannot endanger them or sacrifice their safety.
RepArmstrongND,1268568194945597443,2020-06-04 15:40:01,"Finally, we need to incentivize States to implement similar reforms because the vast majority of criminal justice occurs at the state and local level."

RepArmstrongND,1268568193339142152,2020-06-04 15:40:00,"We should also continue to reform sentencing, such as ensuring total drug weight and firearms enhancements do not apply to defendants who are not directly culpable."
