SenatorDurbin,1274022548330684417,2020-06-19 16:53:40,Today I was honored to stand with¬†@RepChuyGarcia and #DACA recipients¬†-- many of whom have been working as essential health care workers during this crisis -- to discuss¬†establishing a path to citizenship for #Dreamers. #HomeIsHere
SenatorDurbin,1274022546225184769,2020-06-19 16:53:39,"Yesterday‚Äôs Supreme Court decision was historic, but it was just the first step. We need to ensure the protection of #DACA recipients and pass the House-passed American Dream and Promise Act. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/oXjbexqySz"
SenatorDurbin,1273985306392485891,2020-06-19 14:25:41,"This #Juneteenth comes during a moment of reckoning in our nation. The American people are taking to the streets in numbers we've rarely seen before to protest systemic racism &amp; injustice. 
 
We have an opportunity before us to make real change‚Äîlet‚Äôs not waste it. https://t.co/05vv4LO03H"
SenatorDurbin,1273740964973158402,2020-06-18 22:14:45,It would be an American tragedy to deport #DACA recipients who are saving lives in the midst of this pandemic. We cannot afford to lose these talented young immigrants. And we must give them the chance they deserve to become American citizens.
SenatorDurbin,1273740963509403649,2020-06-18 22:14:45,"Congress also has a responsibility to step in. It's been more than a year since the House passed the bipartisan American Dream &amp; Promise Act, which would give #Dreamers a path to citizenship. Senate Majority Leader McConnell must let the Senate vote on this bill now as well."
SenatorDurbin,1273740962037207040,2020-06-18 22:14:44,"President Trump should change course and protect #DACA recipients by:
 
1. Publicly announcing that he will not make another attempt to repeal DACA; and
 
2. Directing DHS to reopen DACA to eligible individuals who have been unable to apply due to his decision to terminate DACA."

Now that #SCOTUS has rejected Pres. Trump‚Äôs repeal of #DACA, we must ensure these essential workers are not sidelined &amp; deported to countries they barely remember."
SenatorDurbin,1273721515826204674,2020-06-18 20:57:28,"Proud to celebrate alongside #Dreamers today at the Supreme Court.
 
But our work is far from over ‚Äî Pres. Trump could try to repeal #DACA again.
 
Congress must step up &amp; provide a path to citizenship for #Dreamers. We must pass the Dream &amp; Promise Act. https://t.co/UJkdnJvdjl"
SenatorDurbin,1273695270853840899,2020-06-18 19:13:11,"It is shameful that even in the middle of a public health pandemic, the Republican Party is continuing its effort to attack the Affordable Care Act in the courts.
 
Justin Walker's nomination was part of that effort, and I was proud to vote no."
SenatorDurbin,1273695268748382213,2020-06-18 19:13:10,"Senate Republicans just gave Justin Walker a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land for two main reasons: because Walker is a prot√©g√© of the Senate Majority Leader, and because he‚Äôs an outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/MKATtF9vnF"
