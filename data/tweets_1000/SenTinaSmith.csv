It will be good to have a day or so to think on all this, and clear my head for next week."
SenTinaSmith,1221216676949172225,2020-01-25 23:41:59,"(5/6) I’ve never been a member of a jury before—I’ve never even been called for jury duty. But it never dawned on me that my 1st trial would be in the U.S. Senate, &amp; it would not include even this most basic element—witnesses, &amp; ability for both sides to cross examine witnesses."

SenTinaSmith,1221216674667470848,2020-01-25 23:41:59,(3/6) What was interesting to me is how their presentation makes the case even stronger for why this trial needs witnesses and the documents.

SenTinaSmith,1220522464578588677,2020-01-24 01:43:26,"I can’t comment on the content of the document. What I can say is classifying a document solely because it contains embarrassing or damaging information is not a good reason.

I’m heading back on the floor for another several hours."
SenTinaSmith,1220522463571910657,2020-01-24 01:43:26,"One other thing: This morning before the Trial started, I reviewed a classified document with a statement from Vice President Pence’s senior aide, describing a telephone conversation between the Vice President and Ukrainian President Zelensky."
SenTinaSmith,1220522462598914049,2020-01-24 01:43:25,The White House lawyers argue in their 171-page brief that abuse of power is not impeachable. Let’s just say it’s hard to find a legal expert to support their position. But we’ll learn more about that when they begin their presentation.
SenTinaSmith,1220522461344731136,2020-01-24 01:43:25,"The House managers provided an excellent review of the constitutional rationale, history and precedent for impeachment for a President’s abuse of power. Even my colleagues with law degrees found it fascinating and full of good information."
SenTinaSmith,1220522459486703617,2020-01-24 01:43:25,Little more than halfway through Day #3. The Senate Chaplin began his opening prayer by urging us not just to hear but to also practice empathetic attentiveness. &amp; to remember our friendships in the Senate. The Chaplin can always be counted on to appeal to our higher principles.
SenTinaSmith,1220155504904765441,2020-01-23 01:25:16,"Lastly, I will say that watching the tapes of the President INVITING foreign interference in our elections—including from China—I asked myself, “is this a big deal?”

And I’ve come to the conclusion that yes, it is a very big deal."

SenTinaSmith,1220155503059390464,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"2) It’s compelling to see how many facts link to Russia—the false theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in our 2016 election; how withholding aid weakened Ukraine in its fight with Russia; and how Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump; and"
SenTinaSmith,1220155502161809414,2020-01-23 01:25:15,1) The facts aren’t really in dispute. Even the President’s lawyers haven’t challenged them so far.
SenTinaSmith,1220155501192908800,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"The House managers’ presentation, led by Congressman Adam Schiff, was a strong summation of the facts and the core issues the Senate faces. Now the House managers are plowing through the timeline and key facts.
We aren’t done for today just yet, but here are my thoughts:"
SenTinaSmith,1220155500148482048,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"I’m keeping notes in a red notebook—kind of a stream of consciousness of quotes, observations, and things to remember. I’m starting to think about questions I want to ask."
SenTinaSmith,1220155499087388674,2020-01-23 01:25:15,"Day 2, after a long night yesterday, and you can feel people settling into this new world of hours sitting on the Senate floor, listening and taking notes. And maybe a catnap or two (not naming names)."
SenTinaSmith,1220017914742497283,2020-01-22 16:18:32,"And THEN, graciously allow a debate on whether witnesses should be called, even though the trial is basically over. All the while, talk about fairness and hope America doesn’t notice.

I think America is noticing."
SenTinaSmith,1220017912829923328,2020-01-22 16:18:31,"Based on how things went yesterday, here’s Mitch McConnell's plan for how to hold an impeachment trial:
    
First, tell the prosecution that they can’t call any witnesses.  Not any. Tell them to argue their case and then let the jury (that’s us) ask questions."
SenTinaSmith,1219780830924591105,2020-01-22 00:36:27,"3) McConnell's move to table seems designed to protect his members from a ""no"" vote on including documents and witnesses for this trial, but I bet Americans will see what's really happening here."
SenTinaSmith,1219780830119198722,2020-01-22 00:36:26,"I’m thinking as I’m writing this:

1) We should be rigorously prepared.

2) We shouldn’t be afraid of the facts and…"

There is tea, coffee, and treats in the cloakroom."
SenTinaSmith,1219780828080869376,2020-01-22 00:36:26,"The President's lawyers seemed to be speaking to an audience of one. On questions of whether the Senate should call for witnesses and documents, they talked about Mueller, Pelosi, and Schiff.

Sometimes it came off as a bit incoherent. They read from notes and seemed unprepared."
SenTinaSmith,1219780827254611968,2020-01-22 00:36:26,"The House managers today relentlessly plowed through questions about witnesses and documents, and asked us essentially ""Why WOULDN'T you want to know this? Why WOULDN'T you want to see the documents?""

I agree."

SenTinaSmith,1219409977208659969,2020-01-21 00:02:48,"Then, two day, 24-hour marathons for presenting each side. Would you want your lawyer to be required to represent you under these circumstances?

It’s outrageous and a clear sign McConnell has no intention of holding the fair trial that Americans expect."
SenTinaSmith,1219409976403341312,2020-01-21 00:02:48,"Just reading proposed GOP impeachment trial rules, which are ridiculous. 

There’s nothing in this resolution that requires hearing witnesses or admitting evidence—which is unlike any trial I’ve ever seen."
