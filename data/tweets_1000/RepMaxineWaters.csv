RepMaxineWaters,1156387006441820161,2019-07-31 02:12:01,"Trump is consistent in his history of racism &amp; vicious attacks on African Americans, from denying rentals to AAs in the 70s, calling for the execution of the Central Park 5, to denying Obama's citizenship, attacking black women, ""The Squad"" &amp; now Congressman Cummings and Bmore."
RepMaxineWaters,1156386165676761089,2019-07-31 02:08:41,"Don't forget, this unpatriotic president was unwilling to fight for his own country, using deferments &amp; bone spurs to dodge military service; refuses to condemn Russia for undermining our democracy; and calls Kim Jong-Un a friend when the world knows he's a ruthless killer."
RepMaxineWaters,1156385776919339011,2019-07-31 02:07:08,"While he defends these despicable dictators, Trump never misses an opportunity to condemn &amp; slander American cities, women, Members of Congress &amp; even members of his own administration."
RepMaxineWaters,1156385210323410945,2019-07-31 02:04:53,"This is the most unpatriotic president that has ever occupied the Oval Office. He doesn't care abt anybody but himself.

RepMaxineWaters,1156382990391554050,2019-07-31 01:56:04,"This is an unpatriotic president who claims to support his daughter (who allegedly cares about the plight of women) &amp; yet has dishonored &amp; taken advantage of women &amp; girls, all as he claimed rapist sex trafficker Epstein as his good friend when we now know he raped younger girls."
RepMaxineWaters,1156381364175986691,2019-07-31 01:49:36,"Congressman Cummings is correct in assessing this president's diversionary tactics and using his vicious attacks and racism to provoke people into fighting one another about racism. We know Trump is a racist. If he never said another word, we know he's the worst racist ever."
RepMaxineWaters,1156381037167075335,2019-07-31 01:48:18,Congressman Cummings is a true patriot who fights for Americans every day. He is not a liar. He is not a divider. He doesn't abuse women. Trump needs to understand that people know the difference between him and Congressman Cummings.
RepMaxineWaters,1153454664123334661,2019-07-22 23:59:56,"The Judiciary members have a good plan to force more info out of Mueller when he testifies before the committee. If this works, this will give us the ammunition we need to start impeachment immediately."
RepMaxineWaters,1153454072239972352,2019-07-22 23:57:35,Testimony from the lawyers who worked with Mueller would be additional and supportive information about #45 and his obstruction of justice and collusion with Russia. We can't stop now. Let's go for it! Impeachment is the answer!
