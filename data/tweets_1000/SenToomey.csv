SenToomey,964206697823678464,2018-02-15 18:36:05,"I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them--criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, and terrorists."
SenToomey,964206696137613313,2018-02-15 18:36:05,"I am committed to improving our federal background check system, which is why my staff and I will continue to reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle to see where progress can be made."
SenToomey,963896503948464129,2018-02-14 22:03:29,My heart breaks for the students and loved ones of those affected by today's terrible school shooting in Florida. Thank you to the first responders for their swift response. Join me in praying for the victims. #stonemanshooting
SenToomey,963880369937371136,2018-02-14 20:59:22,Tune into C-SPAN 2 at 4PM to hear my address to the Senate on why we must pass my #SanctuaryCities amendment to protect communities from dangerous criminals.
SenToomey,963848296392470529,2018-02-14 18:51:55,"Thank you @SenTedCruz, @JimInhofe, @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenDeanHeller, @SenJohnKennedy, @Sen_JoeManchin, and @SenCapito for cosponsoring my bipartisan #SanctuaryCities amendment to keep our communities safe from dangerous criminals."
SenToomey,963795780799737856,2018-02-14 15:23:15,Below is more information on the amendment that I introduced: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWB
SenToomey,963795779298185216,2018-02-14 15:23:14,"This isn’t a controversial issue. Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree that #SanctuaryCities policies must end. When I intro'd my bill in 2016, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted in favor of it. It's time for this madness to end. Let's vote."
SenToomey,963795777813348353,2018-02-14 15:23:14,"In order for any #DACA fix to be meaningful and effective, we can't tie the hands of those who try to enforce the laws we write. #SanctuaryCity policies make it virtually impossible for any #DACA fix to be implemented in good faith. Worse still, they make us less safe."
SenToomey,963795776504770561,2018-02-14 15:23:14,Immigrants want safe cities and communities as much as anyone. My amendment allows cities to protect illegal immigrants who come forward as witnesses or victims of crimes. This is about everyone’s safety.
SenToomey,963795774923526144,2018-02-14 15:23:13,.@SenSchumer says #SanctuaryCities have nothing to do w/border security or #DACA. My #SanctuaryCities amdt focuses on smart immigration enforcement. Following immigration laws &amp; protecting citizens from dangerous criminals in our cities is the 1st step to a secure border.
SenToomey,963795773107339264,2018-02-14 15:23:13,"I hope @SenSchumer and Senate Dems will agree to start holding votes on immigration since they've insisted upon debating it for weeks. First they shut down the government over this, now they’re slow-walking a start to the debate."

SenToomey,963547883642421254,2018-02-13 22:58:11,Below is more information on the amendment that I Introduced today: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWB
SenToomey,963546152821026816,2018-02-13 22:51:19,Enough playing politics with the safety and well-being of the American people. I ask my colleagues to join me in saying no more to #SanctuaryCities. Let’s make these dangerous policies a thing of the past.
SenToomey,963546151319474178,2018-02-13 22:51:18,"Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree: we must end the indefensible policy of protecting dangerous criminals from deportation. #SanctuaryCities do not protect the innocent, they simply make it harder to get violent criminals off the streets."
SenToomey,963546149801070592,2018-02-13 22:51:18,"Other than in enforcing immigration law, there is no other type of crime where a politician-made mandate ties local police hands when an officer thinks – in the interest of public safety – cooperation w/fed. law enforcement is necessary."
SenToomey,963546147917836288,2018-02-13 22:51:18,"Immigrants want safe streets, too, and the bill has language to protect those here illegally who come forward as a victim or witness of a crime."
SenToomey,963546146353352704,2018-02-13 22:51:17,This isn’t about asking local police to enforce fed. immigration law. Fed. immigration officials are merely asking police to hold a person – who’s already been arrested and is in the US illegally – until DHS/ICE can arrive to question or take custody.
SenToomey,963546144898011136,2018-02-13 22:51:17,#SanctuaryCity policies aren’t just unique to Philly. Many of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties have #SanctuaryCity policies. These laws are as misguided as they are dangerous.
SenToomey,963546143434137600,2018-02-13 22:51:17,Philly's extreme + dangerous #SanctuaryCity law prohibited the police from even talking with federal immigration authorities. This wouldn't have happened if Philly wasn't a #SanctuaryCity.
SenToomey,963546141949415424,2018-02-13 22:51:16,"For example: Philly PD once arrested an illegal immigrant, who’d previously been deported, for assault &amp; other charges. Fed. immigration officials asked Philly PD to hold him temporarily. Instead, the man was set free. He was later arrested for raping a child under the age of 13."
SenToomey,963546140472901634,2018-02-13 22:51:16,"#SanctuaryCities are jurisdictions/municipalities, like Philly, that have policies barring local law enf. from cooperating with fed. immigration authorities in certain instances, even in cases when they wanted to help. These policies hamper law enf. &amp; make us less safe."
SenToomey,963546139009175552,2018-02-13 22:51:16,I once again ask my colleagues to focus their attention on the serious problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities. There's lots of misinformation about #SanctuaryCities so here are the facts.
SenToomey,963546137562107904,2018-02-13 22:51:15,"For there to be a good-faith bill on #DACA, dangerous #SanctuaryCity policies must be addressed: DREAM Act says if you commit certain crimes, you lose protections &amp; can be deported. If local law enf. can’t cooperate with DHS/ICE, then this provision is virtually unenforceable."
SenToomey,963546136165343232,2018-02-13 22:51:15,"As we begin to debate the issue of immigration, @SenSchumer is blocking a vote on my amdt to address problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities, putting interests of criminals before public safety."
SenToomey,963521393592856576,2018-02-13 21:12:56,"I was very saddened to hear former Congressman Jon Fox passed away last weekend. My deepest condolences are with his family, friends, and loved ones."
SenToomey,963131160275685376,2018-02-12 19:22:17,"However, it is very important to note that this budget proposal serves only to outline the priorities of the administration and does not carry the weight of law. The ultimate responsibility for passing a budget and funding the government rests with Congress."
SenToomey,963131158757347328,2018-02-12 19:22:17,"Combating opioid abuse, improving veterans’ health care, and boosting funding for national security and our military are worthy priorities President Trump’s budget proposal embraces. I look forward to reviewing this budget proposal in its entirety over the coming week."
SenToomey,961965237133078529,2018-02-09 14:09:19,"This year, @TeamUSA sent the largest ever delegation to the Olympic Winter Games. Very proud to see among the 242 Americans representing our nation in Pyeongchang will be 9 Pennsylvanians! You've all made our commonwealth and nation proud! #WinterOlympics"
SenToomey,961859904041467904,2018-02-09 07:10:46,"Unfortunately, it also adds $131 billion in non-security spending, without any real, meaningful offsetting spending reductions. Our federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path. This spending spree makes it worse."
SenToomey,961859902049107973,2018-02-09 07:10:45,"The budget agreement proposes a badly needed spending increase to strengthen national security, rebuild our neglected military, and honor our commitment to veterans."

SenToomey,961311194417172480,2018-02-07 18:50:23,"The lack of any consequence in this case highlights a flaw in our justice system. This is why @SenTomCotton, @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz and I introduced Eric's Law, to provide justice for murder victims like Officer Eric Williams."
SenToomey,961311192462577666,2018-02-07 18:50:23,"Officer Eric Williams's life was senselessly cut short by a violent gang assassin. His murderer essentially received no punishment for his crime, even though eleven out of twelve jurors voted for the death penalty, because he was already serving a life sentence."
