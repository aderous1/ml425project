RepBenMcAdams,1090671934780641285,2019-01-30 18:03:47,"@darinhorrocks No. If a budget is not passed on time, the bill makes it so the govt will continue operating under an automatic concurrent resolution. It will also stop all congressional salaries and travel funding, and prohibits some White House and cabinet member funding during that time."

RepBenMcAdams,1090306514244591617,2019-01-29 17:51:44,"People in DC love to show how tough they are and call their opponents ‘snowflake.’ Unless the weather forecast includes snowflakes, and then they cancel meetings, leave work early and buy all of the bottled water at the grocery store. Snowflakes. Also, #SkiUtah. #utpol"
RepBenMcAdams,1090275839344762880,2019-01-29 15:49:51,"@HumanFlyer @SenMikeLee I know, right! Weird. I’m still looking for the other Democrats in the Utah delegation so we can take a picture. In the meantime, I’ll work with my colleagues the voters sent here to find common ground where it exists and disagree constructively where it doesn’t. #utpol"
