GerryConnolly,1216141142267396103,2020-01-11 23:33:37,"If you want to stand with the people of Iran, @realDonaldTrump, you could start by not banning them from our country. 

And not threatening to blow up their cultural sites. 

And not further destabilizing their region with your incoherent foreign policy.

Should I keep going? https://t.co/2ILI2oOEc9"

Congress is the ONLY entity with the power to declare war. We'd better start acting like it. https://t.co/wELvDJBCFG"

GerryConnolly,1213067758679863297,2020-01-03 12:01:06,He was a bad actor and masterminded the killings of many US soldiers in Iraq and Lebanon. But his killing will lead to a significant increase in terrorism and retaliatory attacks against Americans.

Radical budget slashing federal agencies
Rolling back telework
