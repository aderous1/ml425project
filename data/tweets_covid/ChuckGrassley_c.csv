0,You’ve heard me say: transparency brings acctability Same principle applies 2health care there’s too much secrecy in health care costs @realDonaldTrump’s rule guaranteeing u get info abt what hospitalization will cost will save patient lots of $$ Promise made/promise kept
1,The economy took massive hit when we took action against the virus falling over 30% in 3 months but economy is roaring back w a 33.1% increase in GDP It looks like in a few months we will hv pre-virus economy back—lowest unemployment in 50yrs Trump’s economic policies r wrking
2,This yr has been unpredictable yet we can always count on our first responders to answer the call of duty to keep our communities healthy &amp; safe Join me in thanking a first responder 2day on #FirstRespondersDay
3,Sen Ernst &amp;I talked to top officials at Dept of health&amp; human services abt 340b program Rural providers rely on these drug discounts &amp;there’s concern abt drug companies cutting back discounts esp during pandemic Iowa Hospitals r very concerned bc they use $$ 2serve low income ppl
4,"VP Biden is officially open 2packing Supreme Court+upending checks&amp;balances of govt Only thing ""out of whack"" w judiciary is judges who act as unaccountable superlegislators Trumps judges incl justices Gorsuch Kavanaugh &amp; Barrett understand their job is 2apply law not make law"
5,To all the journalists who worship freedom of the press (as I do) u should voice ur outrage about the selective censorship from Big Tech like Facebook &amp; Twitter. it violates a constitutional right
6,Democrats put politics above ppl by blocking virus relief bill again 2day this bill had $$$ for schools/testing/tracing/vaccine/small biz We hear Democrats say we shouldn’t do SCOTUS to focus on the virus but we vote &amp; Democrats block us It’s clear Dems don’t want a solution
7,"RT @SenJoniErnst: This #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth, @ChuckGrassley and I are honoring the thousands of Iowans &amp; Americans who are fighting…"
8,Yet again Dems block billions in coronavirus relief to help small businesses &amp; their workers stay on payroll. The popular+ bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program should be something we can all agree on &amp; yet Dems blocked the bill to try to hurt Republicans in the election
9,Compliments to Gov Reynolds &amp; the hard workers in our state. Iowa's unemployment rate has dropped for the 5th consecutive month since govt shutdown the economy bc of the coronavirus. Iowa's economy is humming again &amp; Iowans are getting back to work
10,"Pres @realdonaldtrump kept promise to nominate/confirm strict constructionists to the judiciary but Biden wants nominees who would legislate from the bench &amp; the Left wants to pack the court w a 10th, an 11th, a 12th, &amp; 13th seat on SCOTUS"
11,Talked w Neil Cavuto on Fox Business about coronavirus targeted relief &amp; selective censorship by big tech @ Russell Senate Office Building https://t.co/jSKDkspdmJ
12,Pres @realDonaldTrump kept promise of unprecedented transparency by nominating judges from his public list of supreme court nominees but Biden has kept secret who he would name to our highest court even though he promised a “list” in June
13,.@realDonaldTrump When Trump says he looks out for you he’s talking about the silent majority or the forgotten American so I’m going to quote a famous American who described the forgotten American “he works he votes he generally prays but he always pays“
14,Congratulations are in order for Iowa wrestling LEGEND Dan Gable who is being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by @realDonaldTrump This is the highest civilian honor u can receive BIG NEWS &amp; Gr8 honor for Coach Gable &amp; our state
15,Dems + Republicans agree we need more funding to help students learn safely &amp; for testing/health care. Why can’t we pass that now?  Why did they block Sen. McSally’s proposal to extend extra unemployment? Why all or nothing? Let’s pass needed relief NOW!
16,We could pass targeted relief for families &amp; schools 2day if Dems would let us Everyone knows we can work on 2 things at once so claiming SCOTUS is preventing virus relief is hogwash Democrats insisting on unnecessary items is unreasonable
17,Dems say Senate should focus on virus relief but they won’t take yes for an answer They filibustered a bill full of items they claim to support. Pelosi rejected a bipartisan compromise proposed by House moderates &amp; is insisting on everything she wants or nothing
18,Get this Veep Biden when asked if u wld shut down the economy if need be to fight virus. U said u wld listen to scientists WELL the WHO urged govt not to so do   @realDonaldTrump wld be more in tune w WHO than Biden
19,Agents who did interview didnt think Flynn lied so why push so hard 2prosecute?? Notes show FBI had NO CASE! Not Logan Act Not Lying to FBI Ugly abuse by FBI ldrs
20,Democrats refused to negotiate in good faith &amp;instead tried to use coronavirus as an excuse to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars on unrelated issues. Hopefully the 2 sides can get 2gether on future bipartisan relief bill 2help unemployed/workers/small biz/farmers
21,Barbara &amp; I regularly pray for @realDonaldTrump &amp; our First Lady as 1 Timothy 2:1-2 tells us to pray for those in authority but 2day we hv additional prayer that they get well soon after testing positive for coronavirus
22,Senate just passed BIPARTISAN bill 84-10 to keep govt up &amp; running for the American ppl Impt extensions of infrastructure/health care/veterans/CCC agriculture/pandemic funding included in this bill

24,Judge Barrett is an inspiring American+highly respected jurist She’s an excellent choice for Supreme Ct When hearings begin I'll evaluate this nominee on her merits as I always hv. I hope Dems don’t repeat shameful tactics frm 2018/awful treatment of Kavanaugh whose hrg I chaired
25,I introd bipartisan Accelerating Kids’ Access to Care Act to increase health care access incl across state lines for children on Medicaid w complex medical needs This commonsense legis will relieve some burden by making process simpler &amp;more efficient at no added cost to families
