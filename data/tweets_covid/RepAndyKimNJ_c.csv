0,It's not just the number of cases that's troubling. Eight months in and we're still struggling with basic supplies. This is what happens when you don't have a national strategy. https://t.co/FHXUVsoxRT
1,"The most important thing we can do as we see cases rise is follow the public health guidelines and stay informed. If you're not already, subscribe to my daily #COVID19 update enewsletter here: https://t.co/XicSJ2kO3o https://t.co/iXJ9L3io49"

4,"Across the country, we're seeing a repeat of the Spring: hospitals reaching and exceeding capacity because we can't get a hold of the virus. We need the Senate to step up and pass another recovery package so we can make sure our hospitals can get through this. https://t.co/RYI8FXbL5Z"

116,"Important distinction here on these numbers: if testing is our radar, then lags in testing mean we truly don't have a grasp on the situation at any given moment. https://t.co/DxRPpSqHwt"
117,"This is promising, but we still need a plan so that funding for testing can be used effectively and transparently. https://t.co/fTDnsSQUx8"
118,Nobody's mail - especially our seniors who rely on it for their prescription drugs - should be delayed because of bureaucratic decisions in Washington.
119,To block money for testing is to block money to reopen our schools. To block money for tracing is to block money for our businesses. Both are beyond unacceptable. https://t.co/l2WpBv6Hdd
120,"Following up from my conversation earlier with the Secretary of Treasury and the SBA Administrator, I joined my colleagues on @COVIDoversight in talking with two former chairs of the Federal Reserve. My question to them: what's at stake if we don't deliver aid to states like NJ? https://t.co/ZggQDxyxPg"

123,"Starting on August 11th, you’ll start to see Census workers safely going door to door to make sure we count those who haven’t responded. They’ll be wearing masks and have a Census ID."
124,This confirms everything we assumed; the White House has abandoned listening to top doctors in the middle of a pandemic and is taking direction from partisan ideologs. https://t.co/mhTZYVtbS7
125,"So how do we fix this? We need more testing, we need guarantees that results are processed rapidly, we need to be able to surge testing capacities to hotspots as we see spikes, and we need to follow up with major investments in tracing and isolating."
126,"Testing is a tool. The goal isn’t to test – the goal is to get data so you can act on it. Right now, we’re failing to act because we’re not taking the data we need to act seriously."
127,"So what about the claim that we’re testing more than before? Yes, that’s the case. But in too many places across the country, it takes a week or more to get those test results. At that point, those tests don’t have the impact they would if you got results within 24 hours."
128,"His obsession only with the total number of positive cases misses three major benefits of testing: to provide proper care to those that test positive, to see where the surges are, and to ensure we try to isolate/treat those infected and contact trace."
129,"Why? Because following recommendations from public health leaders brings down cases, not tests. If you have a rodent problem, you don’t solve it by turning the lights out. You solve it by finding out where the mice are coming from and sealing those areas off."
130,"Therefore halving the tests then halves the number of positive cases. In that line of thinking, doubling testing doubles the number of positive cases."
131,"First, let’s look at why it’s wrong. An important flaw of his logic is that it assumes that positivity rates for infections are constant across all levels of testing and throughout our country."
132,This isn't how the math works. It's not how testing works. This isn't going to reopen our businesses and get our kids back to school. https://t.co/r294N3zDj7

135,An important reminder here that the PPP isn't a guarantee for small businesses to stay open - the only way we can do that is to put a firm end through this pandemic by relying on our public health experts. https://t.co/zRY0ExH8F0
136,"If we're going to bring cases down so we can safely reopen our economy and our schools, we need to get testing right. That was true four months ago - and sadly it's still something we're just not doing now. https://t.co/CeDpXMK2IY"
