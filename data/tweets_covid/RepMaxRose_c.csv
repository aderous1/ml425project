341,"Regardless of income, language, or gender identity, they're here to help those who need legal assistance, counseling, social services, or any other support. If you or someone you know has been a victim of domestic violence, learn how you can get help here: https://t.co/3YRSaSFjbs"
342,I've always been in awe of the men and women on the front lines of our healthcare system. Honored to shadow some of my friends @1199SEIU and see firsthand the incredible care they give their patients at Golden Gate Rehab Center. https://t.co/K1AmodRPHg

345,"In our first 200 days in Congress, we‚Äôve had some bright moments: bills to root out corruption, protect healthcare, combat the opioid epidemic &amp; #Renew911VCF.

But as we're leaving tonight to go back to work in our districts, I have one question: Where's our infrastructure bill? https://t.co/Hb328Bp5IE"
