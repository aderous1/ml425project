2,.@SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi have once again blocked #COVID19 relief. They think it gives them a better chance of winning the election. This is a calculated political decision by Democrats. Americans deserve better from those who claim to represent them. https://t.co/sH4XDjm9jy
3,"Democrats are blocking another vote on relief for #coronavirus. @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer need to set aside their political demands, wasteful spending &amp; opposition to more money for a lifesaving vaccine. Now is the time to make an agreement that would benefit Americans. https://t.co/U9TKYs0OmY"
4,We need to pass the #coronavirus bill that @SenateGOP will have on the floor today. This bill will help in targeted ways such as providing another round of #PPP loans to small businesses. @SpeakerPelosi should call the House back to D.C. to pass this bipartisan bill. https://t.co/tWuStIaq1j
