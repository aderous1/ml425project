0,Terrific news. Feds agree to repay $3.3 million taken from FDNY 9/11 Health Fund. Corrects terrible injustice. Heroes healthcare protected. Tough fight that ended well! https://t.co/TxnSm3LW6H
1,Proud to join thousands of great Americans yesterday in Hauppauge supporting our Police who risk their lives for all the rest of us. Back the Blue! God Bless America!! https://t.co/Qhd4THZSEG
2,Totally support @POTUS Trump decision to nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to SCOTUS. Outstanding choice. Brilliant Jurist. Proud to say Judge Coney Barrett is fellow ND Law grad who attended ND same time w my daughter Erin who says Amy Coney was brilliant student &amp; great person.
3,Politicians who say they want communities to trust Police should stop taking cheap shots at cops and tell the non-progressive truth that cops save more lives than anyone. Time for politicians to reform themselves.
4,Wake up call for anti-cop progressives and media allies who want to defund Police. Gallup poll shows 87% of Americans - including 81% of African-Americans - want Police numbers kept at same numbers as before. Thank God for common sense of American people!
5,I commend African-American community leaders who oppose defunding Police and demand the Mayor send NYPD Anti-Crime units back into their communities. Time to end progressive madness and insane political correctness! Too many lives being lost!!
6,Bad form for @MTA to post for big $ jobs while threatening layoffs of workers who have worked courageously through pandemic.
7,Proud to join with @NassauExecutive Curran at Memorial Day ceremony at Eisenhower Park honoring those who made ultimate sacrifice. God Bless America! https://t.co/InLPyuh1e0
8,I support effort by GOP Senators calling for Phase 4 funding. This must include aid to cover pandemic costs and loss of revenues suffered by N.Y. and Long Island. Bankruptcy is not an option.
9,"Time for my fellow GOP Senators and Reps to knock off lies that NY wants fed $ for bailout &amp; pension funds. All we want is compensation for COVID-19. For cops, fire and healthcare workers. Almost 20,000 dead in NYS. Not Blue State issue. Red, White &amp; Blue."
10,"Proud to go on national television to condemn @senatemajldr McConnell’s disgraceful remark that states like NY &amp; NJ should go bankrupt rather than receive federal funds to pay cops, firefighters &amp; healthcare workers risking their lives to fight Coronavirus!

26,"House passes pandemic emergency bill. Victory for America. Large number of Congress Members had to be in House Chamber and risk infection to themselves &amp; others because of 1 arrogant Member. If anyone gets infected, blood is on @RepThomasMassie’s hands!"
27,Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.
