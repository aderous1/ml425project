1,@adamkail Wasn’t meant to normalize him. I’m confident I’ve condemned him more than any U.S. representative who was elected as a Republican. Thanks again.
2,"@adamkail Thanks, though I think it’s a smaller portion who are with him no matter what. The two-party system pushes people into his camp who otherwise would not be with him."
3,"The polls showing Trump losing in #MI03 are no surprise to me or others who pay attention to politics in West Michigan. 2016 was the fluke. This district has been close for many years. While I consistently won by large margins, other Republicans fared worse over the same areas."
4,"Here's an extended version of that clip, and there's a link to the whole episode there, too: https://t.co/zxTQIIteFX"
5,Whoever told you that thing you keep repeating about how social media companies are “getting away with acting like publishers while being protected as platforms under Section 230”—that person misled you. I’m sorry. “Platform vs. publisher” is just not a thing. Read the law.
6,My favorite replies are the ones that rewrite history by pretending I gave Republican speakers a pass. I literally participated in a mutiny to oust one (Boehner) and called another (Ryan) one of the worst speakers in history—in both cases for shutting down legislative process. https://t.co/gq2ZdTAEcq
7,"@RichardManzoNH Correct, but still only in limited cases."
8,@CassandraRules This was years ago. I’m not sure what your grudge is. Donald Trump’s the one who promoted it everywhere and then suddenly claimed not to know anything about it.
9,"@CassandraRules Nope. I told you personal information about private individuals shouldn’t be released but that I didn’t know how much of that was happening, because I wasn’t fully informed on it. It’s weird and not healthy or productive to assume everyone follows that stuff as closely as you do."
10,"The resolution threatens protected speech (absurd as that speech may be), and its prescriptions for addressing QAnon aren’t appropriate for what we know about them &amp; may make things worse.

12,"@LibertyAnders It used to be that Republican grassroots cared about voting records and were disgusted by officials who were all talk. Today, it’s the entertainment/performative aspect that’s applauded, and voting records are mostly ignored. What really matters is how well you own the libs."
13,"@AnonymousStaffr @LibertyAnders GOP and Dem members who aren’t in leadership and aren’t at risk don’t raise money like that. And if you want to be in leadership, you have to sell out your principles. What good is it to have money once you’ve become the same as everyone else? You won’t even remember why you ran."
14,"Agree or disagree with her politics, @AOC is one of the only representatives who takes her responsibilities seriously. Nobody should vote yes on a bill dropped onto the House floor like this without time for careful review. https://t.co/ePyU8XQMLS"

16,Donald Trump’s judicial nominee list includes three senators who supported the reauthorization of FISA 702.
17,"Conservatives and libertarians, like me, who repeatedly criticized Obama for not ending those wars are now supposed to praise Trump for simply promising to do a fraction of what Obama did? Why? Because Trump talks like a guy who wants to end wars? Stop talking; actually end them."
18,"This policy isn’t just detached from the law but also from economics. The unintended consequences will harm the people it’s intended to help. Again, the best form of pandemic relief is direct cash payments to the people. It’s the fairest, most efficient, and least distortionary. https://t.co/SdnmjrZLHS"

21,I’m so sick of partisans.
22,Edward @Snowden is a whistleblower who exposed unconstitutional surveillance practices that violated the rights of millions. He deserves the opportunity to return to the United States and receive a pardon as part of a fair process that examines his actions. https://t.co/JqVccAYd41

24,"Qualified immunity only protects police who *have* violated someone’s rights. If you’re leaving law enforcement because you can’t do your job without violating people’s rights, you won’t be missed.

End qualified immunity. https://t.co/5pwjSy9DIS"
25,Congress is increasingly filled with people who don’t genuinely believe in anything. Their beliefs bend to power.
26,"Colleague: “We need new GOP leadership.”

Me: “Totally agree. McCarthy has been a disaster.”

Colleague: “Yup.”

Me: “So, who gets your vote then?”

Colleague: “McCarthy. I endorsed him this week.”"
27,"When they tell you a bill does X, it almost certainly doesn’t. And they almost certainly didn’t read the bill. Nor did their staff. But they’ll get away with it. Because you want to believe it. And because you heard the same thing from the media, who also didn’t read the bill."
28,@JakeSherman At least modified open in early 2016. But Ryan then became the first speaker in history to lead a whole term (115th Congress) without any open rules. It looks like Pelosi will be the second with this Congress.
29,There will be no fixing Washington from within. It will keep getting worse until the whole system crashes or the public recognizes what’s really going on and forces change from the outside.
30,What happened to support for local decision making? State governments should neither mandate mask wearing nor prohibit local units from mandating mask wearing. https://t.co/SvFhcBK4qB
31,"Unlike my Ending Qualified Immunity Act, the Justice in Policing Act (Democratic House bill) doesn’t end qualified immunity. In fact, it implicitly endorses qualified immunity in such cases. I gave this specific example when discussing the bill’s problems: https://t.co/LVhu64h2Tj https://t.co/I3WkkqDxsK"
32,"The bill doesn’t even address the federal practices that undermine states’ efforts to eliminate civil asset forfeiture, which incentivizes cops to initiate interactions with the public and take property from people who haven’t even been charged with a crime."
33,"The bill tasks the Department of Justice with designing guidance and regulations to implement many of the policing reforms, but DoJ—regardless of who is in the White House—is itself part of our brutal, disastrous criminal justice system."

38,@AspiringNeolib Qualified immunity must end. It’s a harmful doctrine layered upon existing (constitutional) doctrines that already protect police officers who have to make split-second decisions.
39,The Ending Qualified Immunity Act is tripartisan legislation. Let’s make it the law to better protect people from police who abuse power and violate rights.
40,"Thanks to the more than 1,400 athletes, coaches, and personnel from the @NFL @NBA &amp; @MLB who have endorsed the Ending Qualified Immunity Act!

44,"Rioting and looting—that’s selfish, destructive, criminal, contemptible. But a president who assaults peaceful protesters, who threatens military force on American streets, who instigates and escalates—that’s something far more dangerous. That too must be condemned unequivocally."
45,"Until then, we must ensure that those whose rights are violated by police aren’t forced to suffer the added injustice of being denied their day in court."
46,"This pattern continues because police are legally, politically, and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people whom they have sworn to serve. That must change so that these incidents of brutality stop happening."
47,This rule has sharply narrowed the situations in which police can be held liable—even for truly heinous rights violations—and it creates a disincentive to bringing cases in the first place.
48,"Under qualified immunity, police are immune from liability unless the person whose rights they violated can show that there is a previous case in the same jurisdiction, involving the exact same facts, in which a court deemed the actions to be a constitutional violation."
49,"As part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress allowed individuals to sue state and local officials, including police officers, who violate their rights. Starting in 1967, the Supreme Court began gutting that law by inventing the doctrine of qualified immunity."
50,RT @LPNational: We wholeheartedly endorse this proposal.
51,Who originated the false claim that an entity is exclusively a “publisher” or a “platform” under Section 230 (with different liability depending on the *type* of entity)? Ninety-five percent of the confusion on this subject stems from this misstatement of the law.

53,"“That statute tells courts to treat Twitter like a passive distributor of third-party content.”

False. The statute is about what you do, not who you are. You’re not liable when you moderate content. You’re potentially liable when you create content. That’s true for everyone."
54,"As our @LPNational delegates prepare to select our party’s candidates for president and vice president, I encourage you to consider who will best make the party a welcoming place for millions of Americans who already share our principles and values. We must grow to win. https://t.co/6rj59p0ln9"
55,Governor Whitmer cannot legitimately invoke emergency powers on an ongoing basis when the legislature is available to address COVID-19.  It’s not an “emergency” under such circumstances. President Trump tried this nonsense with the wall and arms sales. The same principle applies.
56,"@OrinKerr I appreciate your thoughtful reply. Hayek’s insights don’t apply just to the field of economics. If we’re talking simply about studying (or observing) the spread of a virus, then you’re right that scientists are largely equipped to tackle the problem. But we’re not."
57,RT @MAforAmash: Warrantless government surveillance needs to end. @justinamash is the only candidate who will stop it. #AmashForAmerica
58,"@RadioFreeTom It sounds like you’re making a political point, not a scientific one. The fact that you and I have serious problems with Donald Trump doesn’t mean that local knowledge should be dismissed. It complements scientific knowledge and is critical to effectively tackling the virus."
59,"@RadioFreeTom I’m setting no requirement for their knowledge. Your assumption reflects your own bias. I’m pointing out that we need both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances to effectively fight a virus, but state governments have shown disdain for the latter kind of knowledge."
60,"@SamHarlan7 Correct. More precisely, I’m pointing out that we need both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances to effectively fight a virus, but state governments have shown disdain for the latter kind of knowledge."

62,"@Timothydykstra She should stop forcing all counties to follow the same rules. Fighting the virus effectively requires a bottom-up approach that utilizes both viral science and local knowledge of circumstances. Counties should work cooperatively with businesses, too, to adopt the best approach."
63,"@DemetriKots @1BrianMusser @gtconway3d I didn’t say otherwise. It’s because we don’t have perfect knowledge that local knowledge is important for fighting a virus, just as virology is important for understanding a virus. They are not mutually exclusive, but governors consistently dismiss the first kind of knowledge."
64,"@yourfriendmags As an example, a business owner will know how to manage traffic in her specific grocery store much better than a governor advised by a scientist. Lansing can’t account for particular circumstances. A blanket rule may cause a huge line out the door that helps spread the virus."
65,"@gtconway3d My first tweet should have been more precise, but I’m referring to the actions of individuals, not people in the aggregate. No scientist has such knowledge—because no one person can obtain it. But these micro interactions make all the difference in limiting the spread of a virus."
66,Epidemiologists cannot know the specific actions of each individual in a community. This kind of knowledge is not knowable to any scientist. The top mistake being made by state governments is their imposing uniform rules that limit the use of local knowledge to fight the virus.
67,"A scientist may know a virus’s characteristics, but he doesn’t know a community’s characteristics: how they feel, eat, shop, work, and operate businesses. These items constitute the most useful kind of knowledge—available only locally, and crucial to limiting the virus’s spread."
68,@ScrewJersey I just wrote that people should wear masks.
69,"Practice social distancing, wash your hands, wear a mask—these actions limit the spread of the virus. States should focus on encouraging such things, not on closing businesses or managing their operations. A governor can’t know the particular circumstances to best keep us safe."
70,The Patriot Act must be stopped. Mitch McConnell must be stopped. He’s working to expand warrantless surveillance on the web browsing habits of millions of Americans. A president who cares about privacy and our Constitution would tell McConnell this will be vetoed. Period. https://t.co/0o0csdCZ01

73,"Trump lays out a reckless, unconstitutional understanding of the president’s authority to fight wars. He’s been enabled by predecessors of both parties who waged illegal wars and eroded the American people’s right to be heard in the decision to go to war. https://t.co/MNJAwhSS92"
74,"@lauferlaw @AJDelgado13 I reject the premise an individual should be sacrificed for the greater good, and you’re saying I should be better than that? Don’t you see what you’re saying? It’s horrifying. I don’t know whether Reade’s story is true, but anyone who believes her shouldn’t just dismiss her."
75,@AJDelgado13 Those quotes aren’t mine; they’re from a person who believes Tara Reade but will still vote for Biden. We are in dangerous territory when people who believe accusers—whether Biden’s or Trump’s or anyone else’s—think it’s okay to “sacrifice” that individual for the “greater good.”
76,"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: An economic depression causes massive harm to millions of people, especially the sickest and most vulnerable. No life is worth losing to central planners in government, who can’t know the needs of each individual."

80,@melissanemeth37 It’s directed at the author and many people who seem to be agreeing with her. Donald Trump wins when he changes us—when he makes us reject our own morality and humanity.

98,"Those who voted yes on the last bill created an administrative mess that exacerbated inequities, such as the denial of PPP access to many small businesses—and today’s vote must not send the message that those businesses don’t deserve fairness. This issue must be addressed."
99,"We’ve had weeks to work out solutions to these issues, and we could’ve done so if House and Senate leadership had allowed members to work on and debate today’s bill. Instead, they ignored members who asked for ways to deliberate remotely and negotiated this bill on their own."
100,"The enhanced UI benefits are creating a disincentive to return to work, causing tension with PPP. At the same time, many people who desperately need help aren’t getting it. For those ineligible for UI or other relief programs, the one-time $1,200 check isn’t cutting it."
101,"I voted no on last month’s $2+ trillion coronavirus bill. Among its many failures, that bill denied assistance to millions of people. Today’s bill corrects an inequity by adding funds to PPP. But it doesn’t fix structural flaws that made the last bill so unfair and ineffective."
102,This also would stop the program from continuing to penalize small businesses that find they’re unable to rehire employees because newly enhanced unemployment insurance benefits during the pandemic are bigger than workers’ paychecks would be.
103,"As I said before and after I voted no on the last coronavirus bill, it was never designed to work. The approach is inefficient and fundamentally flawed. The law disadvantages the smallest, least resourced businesses. Even if they get a loan, the PPP/UI interplay creates problems."
104,"@pandemictweeter That’s what you call “justifying your support of Trump”? Giving best wishes to a new administration I didn’t support? And the last two don’t have anything to do with Trump’s election. You’re welcome not to support me, but please don’t make stuff up about November 2016."

108,"The governor needs to allow communities and businesses to establish safety procedures based on actual conditions. Not every place has the same risks, and it’s not good governance, good health science, or good economics to pretend they do."
