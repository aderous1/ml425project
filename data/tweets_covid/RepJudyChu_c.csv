367,We have the phone call w/ Zelensky. We have the anti-corruption ambassador who was forced out of the way. We have witnesses to Trump and Rudy's corruption. Now we have the consequence: impeachment. Trump is #NotAboveTheLaw &amp; we must protect our elections from foreign interference https://t.co/OQNSk8rp8V
368,"When you're in between jobs, #SNAP helps ensure you don't go hungry while you transition. And in fact, almost 75% of recipients find work w/in a year. But that's not fast enough for Trump who is literally taking food from hungry people, while still wasting $$ on a racist wall. https://t.co/WiMF7SiBiu"

370,There will never be justice or safety so long as reckless employers whose buildings collapse because they cut corners can escape punishment by reporting immigrant workers with damning information to ICE. https://t.co/MtCllWaXvy
371,"Employers like to use ICE as a warning to undocumented workers: ""report unsafe conditions, and I'll report you."" The consequences, like in New Orleans, can be fatal. That's why we need the POWER Act - HR 5225 - to protect workers who do the right thing https://t.co/4NFKVsxJHG"

373,This is what happens when an actual white supremacist who spreads Nazi-inspired literature makes US policy. Stephen Miller's agenda is not about what's good for America. It's about racism and hatred. And now we have the e-mails to prove it. Stephen Miller has to go! https://t.co/WF0E3Zm5NK

#GunViolence
#Healthcare

#LGBTQ rights
Just to name a few. https://t.co/BdXqbeNhoc"
376,"Whether you use it for family planning, healthcare, or reasons that are nobody else's business, access to birth control has improved women's health and opportunities. That's why I'm fighting to make sure all women have access to healthcare. #ThxBirthControl https://t.co/Bp3ooRstMJ"
377,"After being invited to settle here, 16,000 refugees from Southeast Asia who have lived here for years are at risk of deportation from the Trump administration's war on immigrants. Today, @CAPAC is hosting a forum to hear from them. https://t.co/05cPGwTg1T"
378,"Obsession with race. Conspiracy theories. Neo-Nazi book recommendations. Bigoted fear-mongering. 

Most people would see these as signs that Stephen Miller has been radicalized into white supremacy. Instead, Donald Trump hired him to make policy. https://t.co/15znIZqpHO"
379,Every child deserves to be loved. But Trump is trying to allow discrimination against LGBTQ adults who want to adopt. This is hateful and hurts children. Not to mention the way it encourages prejudice against the 1 in 5 foster care youth who are LGBTQ. #EveryChildDeservesaFamily
380,"For a guy who kidnapped immigrant children from their parents, made it harder/impossible for them to access lawyers, and is currently setting up sham border courts, Trump sure is concerned about due process when it comes to himself. https://t.co/Vxwcbt4HiU https://t.co/SpnO0cBPG9"
381,This question should be directed to the President who is hiding calls on a secure server and instructing aides to ignore Congressional subpoenas. https://t.co/7ltijRAspo
382,"The @LATimes is right. We can't depend on the courts. It's time to enshrine Roe v. Wade in federal law. As they correctly point out, that is exactly what my bill - the Women's Health Protection Act - will do. Rights do not depend on zip code! https://t.co/kxyaiUHXcc"
383,"I'll never forget meeting Joseph ""Bebo"" Manjikian at his 104th birthday, where he told me about the many members of his family who died in the #ArmenianGenocide. He never forgot them, and neither can we. Today, we finally voted to officially recognize the first modern genocide. https://t.co/nGTcHwy503"
384,"The #climatecrisis is real, and it cannot be ignored. That was the message from @JerryBrownGov , who came to Washington today to talk about the urgent need to address climate change, and how Trump's attack on CA's clean air standards is an attack on the health of all of us. https://t.co/PYWwKir27c"
385,"As part of the war on our right to access healthcare, Alabama tried to ban abortions and imprison doctors. Fortunately, a judge intervened. But they won't stop. We need the Women's Health Protection Act to protect abortion access &amp; ensure our rights do not depend on our zip code. https://t.co/JIsXLYXBnG"
386,"Dental. Vision. Hearing. These aren't optional features, they are a part of healthcare. Today, as part of @WaysMeansCmte markup of #HR3 to make #RX drugs affordable, we are also ensuring that Medicare covers all three. https://t.co/T0cG0dB70P"
387,"Big pharma is going to fight us on this, but we are prepared. Today we begin work on HR 3 to force the government to negotiate drug prices. Nobody should have to choose between healthcare and paying their bills. https://t.co/f18BPYht1p"

389,"These are Turkey's talking points. When a phone call with Erdogan is all it takes for Trump to reverse US foreign policy, green light a slaughter, and then parrot a dictator, it is reasonable to ask who is making US policy? https://t.co/jjcp4ckKOM"

391,#OTD: Trump's #publiccharge rule was supposed to go into effect. But 3 judges blocked it. I joined an amicus brief opposing this rule. This victory - which means continued access to healthcare &amp; food for millions - is why we cannot stop fighting for what's right #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/yROmwrbSYF
392,"Trump's public charge rule would cause ""irreparable harm"" said the NY judge who blocked it today. Of course, harming immigrants was the point. Thankfully, we have courts that uphold justice, and not bigotry. Now it's time for Congress to pass my HR 3222 to block it permanently. https://t.co/Y23xSTUgfx"
