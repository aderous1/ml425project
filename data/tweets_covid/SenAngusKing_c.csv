105,"These changes will let business owners spend their PPP funds over a longer period time, use a larger percentage of the loan on non-payroll expenses (like rent), and more – because no one knows the needs of a business better than the folks who’ve spent their lives building it."
106,"Moments ago, the Senate passed my legislation to improve the Paycheck Protection Program and give more flexibility to small business owners trying to navigate the challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic. The PPP has done good work thus far; now, I hope it can do even more."
