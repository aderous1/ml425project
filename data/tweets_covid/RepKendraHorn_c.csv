59,"Over the last decade, Oklahoma's failure to expand Medicaid resulted in eight hospital closures and our state lost out on billions of dollars that should have gone to health care for our communities. Expanding Medicaid means a stronger investment in our health care system."
60,"Medicaid expansion wins!! Oklahomans have voted to extend health care to working people in our state who for many years have fallen through the cracks. Medicaid expansion means that 200,000 more Oklahomans will now have access to the health care they need. This is a big victory."

72,"Today‚Äôs historic Supreme Court decision affirms that Dreamers are a part of the American family. It means that 700,000 DACA recipients who were brought to the U.S. as kids are protected under the law. Today these Dreamers are service members, teachers, and small business owners."

250,The @GirlScouts Gold Award is THE most prestigious award for youth. Girls who earn the Gold Award tackle issues that are dear to them and drive lasting change in their communities and beyond.

302,"It‚Äôs women‚Äôs health week! I‚Äôll be talking about some legislation we‚Äôre working on to make quality, affordable health care more accessible for women. I‚Äôll also be talking about lesser known services we already have. #NWHW"

307,"Happy National Children‚Äôs Book Week! I‚Äôm so thrilled I get to share this with anyone who comes into our office.
