378,"@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov The bottom line is that we need a fully-funded, coordinated government response to confront the COVID-19 epidemic."
379,@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov It’s crucial that the Trump Administration establish clear chain of command for coordinating the response and act swiftly to restore the global health security teams at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security that are charged with managing pandemics.
380,"@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov After the Ebola outbreak of 2015, federal pandemic response teams were established and the Trump Administration eliminated them as a cost-saving measure. This shortsighted approach has put our nation at a significant disadvantage in handling the global spread of COVID-19."

382,@GovJanetMills @AppropsDems @CDCgov I'm extremely troubled by reports about the high costs incurred by people who’ve done the right thing + proactively been tested for coronavirus.
