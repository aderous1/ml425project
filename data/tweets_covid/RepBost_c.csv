I have 2 daughters and 7 granddaughters. I'm thankful they can shape their government because of the generations of women who came before them. #WomensVote100 https://t.co/HP6OYg3hlJ"

227,It's now been 21 separate times Nancy Pelosi and her allies have blocked legislation to protect infants who have been born alive. This is not about abortion.

237,@egomro4 @IRSnews Hi Eric. Please share with those who may benefit from this information rather than trying to politicize a public service announcement. Have a great weekend!
238,We need to enforce the laws already on the books rather than limit the rights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families. I think @SteveScalise would've gotten that point across had he been allowed to testify when these bills were under consideration in committee.
