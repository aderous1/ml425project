279,My provision in the¬†#COVID19¬†relief bill supercharges unemployment to provide workers with an additional $600 a week. This will be a lifeline for the millions of workers who have been hit by this economic wrecking ball.
280,On day one of negotiations for the #COVID19 relief package I made it clear that my bottom line was helping workers replace lost wages.

323,"I just voted no on the partisan #COVID19  bill. Here's why: while nurses are being forced to make their own masks and gowns, McConnell and Trump are busy creating a taxpayer-funded slush fund for their buddies. I will stay here as long it takes to get this done the right way."
324,"Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump need to accept the fact that the cure for #COVID19 isn't a secretive taxpayer-funded bailout of multinational corporations. This deal will get done, but it‚Äôs got to get done the right way."
