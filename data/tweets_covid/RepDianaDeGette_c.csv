https://t.co/GMGYNFw286"
325,"The Supreme Court‚Äôs decision that it has no role in partisan gerrymandering cases is a devastating blow to our democracy. ‚ÄúIs this how American democracy is supposed to work?‚Äù Justice Kagan asked in her dissent.
 
No, no it's not."
326,"This administration is failing these migrant kids. Our agencies need to be working together. The health and safety of these children should be everyone‚Äôs top priority, above all else. 
https://t.co/rNyMdlb2tw"
327,"We need these agencies working together, and we have to find a way to break down any barriers preventing them from doing that. Because, right now, what we have is a system that's breaking down, and when that happens it is the kids who are hurt the most. https://t.co/umCGwtvAp4"
328,"When we fail to protect our environment, it is often the poorest among us who suffer most.

329,We must continue to fight this. Over four million Americans rely on Title X funded-clinics for their health care. This administration‚Äôs gag rule will put their health at risk! https://t.co/cSkqhMgh7u

331,"Today is #Juneteenth. I hope you‚Äôll join me in taking time today to honor all those who stood up for our nation‚Äôs promise of freedom for all, and remind ourselves that there is still much more work that needs to be done. #TodayIsJuneteenth https://t.co/khEpbcF7qP"
332,"The Trump administration has no evidence that #TitleX money is being used to fund abortions, as prohibited by current law. There‚Äôs no reason why HHS would need to create this new rule to cut off Title X funding to health care clinics across U.S. #ProtectX #SaveTitleX https://t.co/1ab0V83ZGL"
333,"4 million people rely on #TitleX funded clinics for health care. But now, the Trump admin is trying to block funding to these vital facilities. Today, we are going to question Trump‚Äôs top official in charge of this awful plan.

338,"This is why we need more women in Congress. After Crystal Ellis told a committee how she lost her son in an accident involving an unsecured dresser, it was the women &amp; moms in Congress who rushed to meet her afterward. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud to serve with so many amazing women. https://t.co/2VIaor6FUe"
339,"Four former EPA administrators agree: The current administration‚Äôs EPA is on the wrong track. We can‚Äôt protect our environment and public health if we ignore science. EPA‚Äôs policy need to be based on science, not politics. https://t.co/COOFwhdmzI"
340,"These 182+ companies get it: Restricting access to reproductive health care, including abortion, threatens our companies, our communities and our economy. Thank you for this important message in today‚Äôs @nytimes. #DontBanEquality https://t.co/HvLWsAoP4s"
341,"Each year, over 36,000 people are killed by gun violence in the U.S. #EnoughIsEnough.

342,"75 years have passed, but the heroism of the brave soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944 will never be forgotten.

343,Congress just sent a $19 billion disaster relief bill to the President to be signed into law. This important bill will help communities across the country who are struggling to get back on their feet after a natural disaster ‚Äì including those in Colorado impacted by wild fires.
344,"As @BusyPhilipps said today, ‚ÄúAbortion is health care &amp; should not be treated any differently from other health care.‚Äù 

Thank you Busy for your bravery &amp; courage to testify about your own abortion. Together, we will stop the GOP's war on women's health.

347,The Trump admin just unveiled a new rule that would let health insurers &amp; providers DENY care to transgender patients and those who‚Äôve had an abortion. These ongoing efforts by the Trump admin to do away with reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights must be stopped! https://t.co/0eC25Exvv2
348,"Government can't fight this #climatecrisis alone. We need the support of businesses too.
