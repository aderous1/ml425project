1,"A vote for Justice Barrett was a vote to deprive Americans of health care, reproductive freedom, voting rights, civil rights, &amp; more. Barrett obfuscated &amp; refused to answer basic questions, but her record was clear.

The American people will be even clearer in their dissent. https://t.co/8eCIPFtvZv"
2,"In his interview with @LesleyRStahl @POTUS showed who the real Donald Trump is: Incompetent, Impudent, Ignorant, Illogical, Idiotic, Immature, Imbecilic, Irresponsible and all about “I”"
3,"Bravo to San Francisco &amp; @LondonBreed for leading the way for the country in recognizing the value of science, medicine, &amp; facts in combating COVID. We’re not out of the woods yet, &amp; this has been tough on everyone, but if we continue to do what’s right we can end this pandemic! https://t.co/EvjXNpyBL0"
4,Good morning. 54 million Americans - 40% of those who voted in 2016 - have already voted in this election and Senate Republicans are still ramming through a Supreme Court nominee to take away your health care amid a pandemic.
5,"If we were watching these antics in a 3rd world country we would decry them, but not here &amp; not now: 12 days before the election ends, w/42 million votes already cast, @senjudiciary Republicans advanced Judge Barrett's SCOTUS appt to destroy health care amid a deadly pandemic. https://t.co/FS7JVGMVZg"
6,80% forced out of work last month were women. 1 in 5 working-age adults is unemployed because COVID-19 upended #childcare w/women 3x more likely than men to stay home w/the kids. The House passed the #HEROESAct to help working moms. What's the Senate waiting for?! #momsbailout
7,"How is this a democracy when we eliminate 21,000 polling places across the country heading into Election Day? It may be harder to vote than get a COVID test on November 3. https://t.co/rvpa0XK1hV via @vice"
8,.@POTUS’s Dr. Atlas heading the coronavirus task force is blocked on Twitter for denying the effectiveness of masks. He will probably say bleach works very well. He is as reckless as POTUS and as ignorant.
9,Senator Kamala Harris is right! People are scared that the ACA will be overturned and 7 million Americans who have contracted COVID-19 will have preexisting conditions and can be rejected by insurers. That's what this Supreme Court appointment is all about.
10,RT @lyzl: Every man praising Amy Coney Barrett's motherhood supports a president who ripped children away from their mothers at the border
11,"Justice Barrett shared in her opening statement how Justice Scalia shaped her judicial philosophy. It was Justice Scalia who said, “Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It does not.”"
12,"Senate Republicans keep lambasting Democrats’ desire to confirm “activist judges,” yet @POTUS is the one who pledged to confirm judges who will overturn Roe v. Wade &amp; stole a Supreme Court seat nearly a year before the 2016 election. The hypocrisy &amp; gaslighting is mind boggling."
13,"This International #DayOfTheGirl, let’s remember that 2/3 of youth not in school, employment, or training are women &amp; recommit ourselves to girls’ education, freedom from violence &amp; access to healthcare &amp; nutrition.

14,"We’re in a she-cession. 73% of those dropping out of the workforce in September were women. If POTUS cares at all about women he’ll pass child care stabilization &amp; help crush the virus so we can safely reopen schools &amp; the economy. Instead, he bloviates! https://t.co/knrrvsuZkC"

16,Why are senior military leaders going to WH receptions where no one is wearing a mask during a pandemic? Why is the White House telling the Pentagon not to disclose positive tests in senior leaders while they downplay the severity of the virus and refuse to take preventive steps?
17,What if the Joint Chiefs’ responsibilities cannot be done remotely while they are isolating? How many other senior military leaders have tested positive? Why weren’t we safeguarding the health of senior military leaders like the natural security asset that it clearly is?
18,Why are senior military leaders going to WH receptions where no one is wearing a mask during a pandemic? Why is the White House telling the Pentagon not to disclose positive tests in senior leaders while they downplay the severity of the virus and refuse to take preventive steps?
19,Why are the joint chiefs not holding their meetings remotely using DoD’s secure conference systems before the exposure? The Pentagon has had 7 months to implement remote and physically distanced work arrangements. Who’s deciding when to meet in person vs. electronically?
20,"The nation’s most senior military leadership are now isolating due to coronavirus exposure. This raises some Qs: Why were the joint chiefs all in the same Pentagon room at once in close contact during a pandemic? Were they wearing masks?

24,"While @POTUS is taking a joyride around Walter Reed to wave at his adoring fans like a king, I’m pleased to see him wearing a mask. Now that he knows the dangers of covid personally, we must demand he imposes a national mask mandate. It will prevent 60,000 deaths by year's end."

29,A vote for Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to take away our health care. It’s that simple.
30,"As millions of Americans struggle to meet basic needs due to the pandemic that @POTUS has failed to address &amp; an embattled economy made worse by his fecklessness &amp; ego, we have definitive proof that Trump is nothing more than a grifter &amp; con man unfit to serve as President."
31,"He's on the hook for a whopping $421 million in debt, due over the course of the next 4 years. What level of national security will he sell out to his Russian benefactors for bailing him out this time?"

33,"The Pentagon &amp; DoD have long held the mantle of some of the worst incidents of government waste, fraud &amp; abuse, but this sets a new, shameful low.

40,"Testifying before the Senate &amp; under oath, CDC Director Redfield was unequivocal: vaccines won’t be ready until next year &amp; wearing masks is the best protection. Yet @POTUS, averaging 23 misleading claims a day, says he's wrong. If anyone is “mistaken” or “confused” it’s Trump. https://t.co/Y221lwCJXQ"
41,"Nearly a decade ago, I started reading the stories of military sexual assault survivors on the House floor and fighting for these changes. We faced pushback from both Ds and Rs who called our proposed changes too bold or feared disrupting the status quo."

44,".@POTUS - viewing historic fire devastation in CA- said it will get colder. Is he using the arrival of fall to pretend climate change-like COVID-will just vanish? Does he know Gingrich beat him to that con in 2009, when he declared it was snowing so there was no global warming?"

51,"It's malfeasance for @POTUS to admit he knew COVID was deadly but put on a happy face telling the American public ""it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” He did it for one reason - to prop up the stock market &amp; his reelection.

118,"Russia undermined our democracy in 2016 &amp; continues to meddle in our elections, put bounties on the heads of our troops &amp; now is attacking our COVID-19 vaccine research - &amp; not a peep from the President. Why bother hacking? Just ask @POTUS. He'll give you anything you want."

124,"It took 4 weeks for the U.S. to jump from 2M COVID-19 infections to 3M. Most experts say it’ll take less than a month to surpass 4M, yet @POTUS bragged about 130K dead &amp; said we could have “way over a million.” His prediction could still come true. #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie"

333,"That’s 50 people who have suffered serious, debilitating injuries to protect our country &amp; who @POTUS  has belittled &amp; denigrated. I hope my colleagues on the House Armed Serices Committee will help educate Trump.  https://t.co/tAWKHiE7iQ"
334,"#WeRemember these nightmarish images &amp; the 6 million Jews exterminated – as well as those who survived – so that that we may never repeat the horrors of our past; a past destined to become our future if we fail to fight the present day rise in anti-Semitism, bigotry &amp; hatred."
335,Truly what kind of a country are we when a US Senator takes cheap shots at a Purple Heart recipient who has dedicated his life to protect us. Shame on you Sen. Blackburn. You’re better than that. https://t.co/DnISSkrKFP
336,This is a hostage situation. Trump is willing to hold up ALL of CA’s federal health care funds - BILLIONS of $$ - unless California undermines abortion coverage. The cruelty has no bounds. Women and the most vulnerable are the casualties. We won’t stand for it!  #CaliforniaStrong https://t.co/UsdIcihvaJ
337,Joining @ewg at 5:30 pm PT TODAY for a screening &amp; panel discussion of Dark Waters at Century Redwood City Downtown. This film features attorney Rob Bilott’s fight to hold PFAS manufacturers accountable for endangering public health. Looking forward to a great conversation!

339,"In Mozambique, a provider had to close 18 youth health centers &amp; 72 mobile clinics. In Kenya, the largest repro org had to close 2 clinics &amp; eliminate free mobile outreach services for 76,000 women. In Uganda, a provider ended a contraceptive program for 6,000 youth. And so on."
340,Today is the 3rd anniversary of Trump's #GlobalGagRule forcing health care providers abroad to choose between providing comprehensive care &amp; keeping their funding. This Administration's assault on women's health care &amp; bodies literally has no bounds! The result is devastating⬇️
341,If @POTUS can defy congressional subpoenas we should shut the doors of the Capitol and return our salaries to the Treasury because Congress would be impotent and we would have a full blown autocrat in power who can do ANYTHING with impunity. I guess we should just “get over it.”
342,"Those who’ve waged war on abortion rights have seen our power as we took to the streets for the Women’s March, and we marched to the ballot box in 2018. Get ready for 2020, because we will not go back!"
343,"This #MLKDay2020, let us look to Dr. King’s example as a beacon of light who inspires us to be our best despite those seeking to divide us. As Dr. King wisely intoned, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” https://t.co/m8eaSdA5k9"
344,"During a tantrum @POTUS called Mattis, w/40+ years of service, &amp; the joint chiefs “dopes and babies.” That's a 5x draft dodger who cried about bone spurs demeaning the service of men who have devoted their lives to protecting our country. #thisisnotnormal https://t.co/df9sPvpall"
345,"To those attacking the timing - this is what happens when @POTUS forces people to defy congressional subpoenas - shoes keep dropping, evidence eventually emerges, Trump’s henchmen who are left in the cold keep leaking details that could have been turned over MONTHS ago by Trump."
346,Parnas becomes this year’s Michael Cohen-doing Trump’s dirty work and going to jail for it. Who wants to be next? https://t.co/mf52SBXkQp
347,"Today, we stand on the shoulders of giants who have fought for an Equal Rights Amendment affirming women’s equality &amp; prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. Virginia’s vote to be the 38th state to ratify proves there's no exp date on equality! https://t.co/mVNhAurW4x"
