0,Many child care facilities in NH are at risk of closing their doors due to the financial impact of #COVID19. They are crucial to NH‚Äôs economic recovery &amp; working families.

Tourism is NH‚Äôs 2nd largest industry ‚Äì supporting tens of thousands of jobs, local communities &amp; NH's economy. https://t.co/8PX4Qj0NRw"
2,"During COVID-19, survivors of domestic violence &amp; sexual assault have often been trapped at home w/their abusers. Republican stonewalling on COVID relief &amp; VAWA reauthorization is partisan politics at its worst. Survivors &amp; assistance orgs need help NOW. https://t.co/CMWMdjazgM"
3,"From the frontlines of the opioid epidemic to COVID-19 ‚Äì first responders endure tremendous stress &amp; risk to protect Granite Staters. On #NationalFirstRespondersDay &amp; every day, we thank our firefighters, law enforcement, emergency personnel &amp; all who answer the call to serve."

29,üö®NEW! NH has just been awarded $1.75M in federal support to establish a new family drug court in Sullivan County. This is huge for the region &amp; significant for NH ‚Äì the outcomes can help shape our continued response to the substance use disorder epidemic throughout the state.
30,"After months of stalling, Pres. Trump &amp; McConnell are STILL upending efforts to get help to the American people.
