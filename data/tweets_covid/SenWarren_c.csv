1,Our @MassGenBrigham doctors found that a common formula for measuring kidney function discounted the severity of Black patients’ problems. I want @AHRQnews to review the use of these algorithms so they aren’t worsening health outcomes for people of color. https://t.co/AkQz6NRU9o
2,"As usual, DeVos is wrong. That’s why @SenTinaSmith and I urge @usedgov, @HHSGov, and @CDCgov to provide complete, transparent, and timely national reporting of COVID-19 cases in schools and actually help guide families and schools through this pandemic. https://t.co/qZqlqW0NdD"
3,Trump’s Secretary of EDUCATION @BetsyDeVosED shrugged her billionaire shoulders and said it’s not her job to help keep track of COVID school reopening plans or outbreaks. Parents and teachers deserve better than this abdication of leadership. https://t.co/TWP6vqMqio
4,"The White House put out a political puff piece taking credit for ""ending the COVID-19 pandemic.” Is this a sick joke? The pandemic is getting worse. Americans are dying. And Donald Trump is incapable of leading the country through this crisis. https://t.co/4Dw6QwYFFt"
5,"Trump said in the debate that the military will distribute a COVID-19 vaccine, but the Senate Armed Services Committee hasn’t had a hearing yet to get the details. Given @DeptofDefense's role in Operation Warp Speed, @MazieHirono and I want that hearing. https://t.co/RTTDJX5tQp"

359,"Massachusetts faces 2 outbreaks this summer: the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, &amp; the mosquito-borne EEE that killed 15 people in 2019. I’ve urged @CDCgov to work with state &amp; local govts to address the EEE threat &amp; will stay on them to hold them accountable. https://t.co/K56jqHZlim"
360,"Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs during this pandemic, small businesses are struggling, &amp; Trump’s political appointees at the @CFPB just finished gutting the rules that protect Americans from predatory payday lenders. This is appalling. https://t.co/TkqHA4n2Gu"
361,"Cuando la economía colapsó en 2008, los latinos fueron algunos de los más afectados. Si el gobierno no actúa ahora, el COVID-19 tendrá un efecto catastrófico similar. Lee mi opinión sobre lo que el Congreso debe hacer en el próximo paquete de ayuda: https://t.co/gdE2lmIwRn"
362,"When our economy crashed in 2008, Latinos were some of the hardest hit. If the government doesn't act now, COVID-19 will have a similarly catastrophic effect on the Latino community. Read my op-ed on what Congress should deliver in the next relief package: https://t.co/mljIpLBkYg"
363,The COVID-19 pandemic is not over and grocery store workers are still putting their lives on the line to keep Americans fed. I’m joining @UFCW and @SenMarkey in urging @StopandShop and other grocery chains to extend premium pay for their essential workers. https://t.co/ZF2UzIqUbm
364,"Our government didn't have a stabilization and recovery plan when Wall Street crashed our economy in 2008, or when COVID-19 crashed our economy again in 2020. It’s long past time to prepare in advance for downturns and invest in economic resilience. https://t.co/HAvcbkirSW"
365,"The expansion of unemployment benefits during COVID-19 has been a lifeline for families and for the economy. A fair wage guarantee is one powerful way we can keep helping workers, employers, and our economy recover when it’s safe to return to work. https://t.co/eXhLxjv59l"
366,"Kicking international students out of the US during a global pandemic because their colleges are moving classes online for physical distancing hurts students. It’s senseless, cruel, and xenophobic. @ICEgov and @DHSgov must drop this policy immediately. https://t.co/MHYduGA1Pk"
367,"The Enhancing Oversight to End Discrimination in Policing Act would:
✅ Rescind the Sessions limits on the use of consent decrees
✅ Empower state AGs to pursue pattern or practice investigations
✅ Triple funding for DOJ’s @CivilRights Division to pursue these cases"
368,RT @SenBooker: US meatpacking companies lobbied Trump to keep their plants open during a pandemic—putting workers’ lives at risk—in order t…
369,The @NYTimes shouldn’t have to sue the @CDCgov for access to COVID-19 racial disparities data that confirm Black &amp; Brown families are bearing the brunt of this virus. The White House should release a plan to fight this virus in communities of color – now. https://t.co/Yc02awyQsF
370,"Wishing everyone in Massachusetts and across the US a safe and happy July 4th! Remember that staying home, social distancing, and wearing a mask are all important ways to protect yourself, your friends, family, and neighbors so everyone can celebrate more July 4ths to come."
371,My friend &amp; former @USDOL Secretary @RBReich is right: @OSHA_DOL abandoned workers by refusing to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard for COVID-19. The Senate needs to pass @SenatorBaldwin &amp; @SenDuckworth’s bill to make OSHA implement workplace safety rules for the pandemic. https://t.co/8qsnOITilC
372,Denying trans individuals access to safe shelter at any time – but particularly in the middle of a pandemic – is morally reprehensible. HUD must abandon this discriminatory proposal &amp; support everyone's right to seek shelter consistent with their identity. https://t.co/1QpsLseusZ
373,"RT @RepMaloney: #COVID has made clear that the federal govt must do more to protect residents of assisted living facilities. Today, @SenWar…"
374,I have serious concerns about the safety &amp; security of US servicemembers who may have Russian-funded bounties on their heads. I've also asked the US commander in Afghanistan for information about what the military is doing to protect our servicemembers. https://t.co/jiyeL2FcG1
375,We need to boost our country’s pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity for the COVID-19 crisis &amp; any future pandemics. @SenTinaSmith &amp; I have a new bill to end our over-reliance on foreign countries &amp; give us the tools to produce critical drugs here at home. https://t.co/M7UpGvjsK6

377,"Public health officials &amp; assisted living residents &amp; their families need to know about COVID-19 cases &amp; fatalities. @RepMaloney, @SenMarkey &amp; I have a new bill to enact strict data collection and reporting requirements for assisted living centers. https://t.co/pVWDj2xbHm"
378,"My report with @RepMaloney &amp; @SenMarkey found:
❌ 24% of assisted living facilities had at least 1 COVID-19 case. 8% had 10+ cases
❌ 43% of infected residents were hospitalized. 31% died.

That means about 7,000+ assisted living residents may have died from COVID-19 as of 5/31."
379,Assisted living centers have similar COVID-19 risks as nursing homes but not the same regulations &amp; reporting requirements. We investigated assisted living operators &amp; found alarming infection &amp; fatality rates. Congress must require this data collection. https://t.co/YvmWj3leIu
380,I support the Cambridge City Council’s resolution of solidarity with @WholeFoods workers who want to wear #BlackLivesMatter masks &amp; speak out against systemic racism. This is an absurd policy. But @Amazon must do much more to address the racial inequalities in their company.
381,Workers of color at @Amazon warehouses &amp; @WholeFoods stores have spoken out for months about unsafe COVID-19 conditions. Black whistleblowers have been fired &amp; subjected to racist slurs by executives. And workers have described a “pattern of racial bias.” https://t.co/FLUFVpeagl
382,"Amazon has no problem making money selling #BlackLivesMatter masks on their platform. If the retail giant believes in those words &amp; isn’t just exploiting them, they will let @WholeFoods employees wear their masks. https://t.co/VJuCFci7h4"
383,HHS reportedly plans to add personal information to its COVID-19 database. I’m worried that sensitive HHS data could be accessed and weaponized by agencies like ICE. It's happened before. @HHSgov must explain how they are protecting people’s privacy. https://t.co/wPaj4O4pZ3
384,"The pandemic – and its human and economic costs – grow daily because the Trump administration has failed to deliver on every aspect of the coronavirus response. It is well past time for @VP Pence, Trump, and this administration to address these problems and save American lives."
385,"Here's the reality: the White House ignored the threat of COVID-19 until it was too late to stop it, left states without the equipment to adequately fight it, did not do enough to work with states to contain it, and is now shirking its responsibility to continue to address it."
386,"Dr. Fauci told me the US could see 100,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day if we don’t shift course. But rather than ramping up testing &amp; contact tracing, securing our supply chain, &amp; sending clear guidance to Americans, @VP Pence &amp; the Trump admin declared victory over the virus."
387,"COVID-19 is surging and Dr. Fauci gave a catastrophic warning to me yesterday. Either @VP Pence doesn’t have the slightest comprehension of the outbreak, or he is deliberating trying to mislead the American people. He owes the American people answers. https://t.co/qLIPMWyw9b"
388,.@RepDebHaaland &amp; I asked @USCCRgov to examine the impact of the federal government's COVID-19 response on Native communities. The Commission is doing so. It will hold a virtual public briefing &amp; seek public input. I hope those most directly affected will make their voices heard. https://t.co/ZFqZdJJ3p2
389,"It's July 1st, the rent is due, &amp; millions of families have no idea how they’re going to pay it. The Senate must step up to extend &amp; expand the eviction moratorium that expires this month to keep people in their homes during this pandemic. https://t.co/kzZahQMON4"
390,"Removing the names, symbols, &amp; monuments that honor Confederate soldiers who killed Americans in defense of slavery is only one step toward addressing systemic racism in the US. But it’s an important step. Congress has the power &amp; responsibility to end this injustice. https://t.co/nv9j7C6kyp"
391,COVID-19 made it clear: our dependence on foreign countries for pharmaceutical drugs &amp; drug components threatens our public health &amp; national security. We must take control of our supply chain. @SenRubioPress &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to find solutions. https://t.co/3OGrrslfro
392,"There were 21,000 new COVID-19 cases the day Dr. Fauci told me we were going in “the right direction.”
There were 40,000+ new cases yesterday.
And Dr. Fauci told me today there could be 100,000 new cases/day if we don’t reverse course.

Trump &amp; other leaders need to face reality. https://t.co/NApUxo7wK0"
393,"When Dr. Fauci testified in mid-May, he told me that the US had not contained COVID-19, but he thought that we were going in ""the right direction."" I’m about to ask Dr. Fauci if he still thinks that's the case. Tune in live now.  https://t.co/Yr6pb87erX"
394,Dr. Fauci &amp; other top federal public health experts are back testifying before the Senate this morning to update us on the COVID-19 response. Watch live here. https://t.co/Yr6pb8oPjv
395,Community health centers like Upham’s provide critical care for anyone who walks through their doors. They often serve low-income &amp; Black &amp; Brown communities hardest hit by COVID-19. Congress should listen to our doctors &amp; help CHCs keep their doors open. https://t.co/vnJlTYIZ1e
396,The Court’s decision to strike down Louisiana’s abortion law is a victory for reproductive rights. But these state attacks on Roe v. Wade are like a right-wing game of Whack-a-Mole. Congress must pass the Women’s Health Protection Act. #MyRightMyDecision https://t.co/szlikpZEjy
397,"In MA and across the country, communities are bracing for a surge of evictions that could leave families homeless. This will only worsen the public health and economic crisis. Housing is a human right – Congress must step in to keep people in their homes. https://t.co/pIz2kizEmx"
398,"Black &amp; Brown communities are most at risk for eviction if we don't extend this moratorium. They’ve been hardest hit by COVID-19. Their businesses haven’t received as much relief. They're more likely to have lost income, and less likely to have savings to weather the crisis."
399,Renters who lost their jobs because of the pandemic shouldn’t have to fear losing their homes too. Today I’m introducing legislation with @RepChuyGarcia &amp; @RepBarbaraLee to extend the federal eviction moratorium through March 2021. https://t.co/D977PDqfRR
400,"Now, the Supreme Court should not have ignored the intent of Congress and allowed the President to remove the @CFPB director without cause. They just handed over more power to Wall Street's army of lawyers and lobbyists to push out a director who fights for the American people."
401,"If @AmericanAir wants to pack planes like sardines during a pandemic, they should fully refund passengers who don’t want to fly on their airline. I urged them to give cash refunds 3 months ago. Now Congress should force them by passing @SenMarkey’s bill.
https://t.co/iEljy4MDiw"
402,"Trump used COVID-19 as an excuse to roll back more @EPA safeguards, even though most of us know we need to combat the #ClimateCrisis. Congress must pass #GreenNewDeal legislation to invest in clean energy, fight for environmental justice &amp; save our planet. https://t.co/hFrIed34lJ"
403,President Trump cannot divert Pentagon funding to his monument to hate at the border. Congress should do even more and pass the bill I introduced in March to redirect every available penny of funding for that dumb wall to fight COVID-19. https://t.co/spP10Ae1HM
404,COVID-19 is still spreading. I’m worried @TheJusticeDept is dangerously rushing to reopen immigration courts. I’ve led a letter questioning this decision &amp; cosponsored @SenMarkey’s bill to stop deportations &amp; postpone in-person hearings during this crisis. https://t.co/8gUlYxan51
405,Child care centers were already operating at razor-thin margins before COVID-19. Smaller classes &amp; higher costs could collapse this broken system even after reopening. States can't fix this crisis alone. Congress still must pass a $50B child care bailout. https://t.co/TJSF5sTHGP
406,This crisis has left private equity firms drooling over struggling companies they can gobble up. Congress should pass my #StopWallStreetLooting Act to fundamentally reform private equity &amp; my bill with @RepAOC to stop predatory mergers &amp; acquisitions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
407,"The private equity industry's playbook – buying up companies, bleeding them dry, &amp; cutting jobs – is especially troubling right now for their nursing homes &amp; health care staff. These firms care more about lobbying for bailouts than supporting their communities &amp; workers."
408,Private equity firms have gutted companies &amp; killed jobs long before COVID-19. Now I’m concerned they’re exploiting the public health &amp; economic crises to line the pockets of wealthy firms at the expense of our communities. #StopWallStreetLooting https://t.co/9TivNFQ3hP
409,"Trump’s incoherent tariff-by-tweet policies plummeted lobster exports. His disastrous COVID-19 response hurt lobstermen more. And offshore drilling &amp; refusing to fight the #climatecrisis threatens the industry long-term.

Stop blaming @BarackObama for your failures, Mr President. https://t.co/Jj0TLzwSr7"
410,Capital One and other major debt collectors have been garnishing wages of struggling customers during the pandemic. That’s just wrong – and it will only worsen the public health and economic crisis. @SenSherrodBrown and I want them to stop now. https://t.co/xldMMhOzyX
411,"Capital requirements aren’t just financial jargon. Millions lost their jobs, homes, &amp; life savings when Wall St recklessly gambled &amp; lost in 2008. The @FederalReserve, @FDICgov &amp; @USOCC should reverse the SLR rule &amp; keep financial institutions stable during our COVID-19 recovery."
412,Real change in policing starts with accountability for police officers who kill unarmed Black people. An end to qualified immunity for law enforcement. A full ban on chokeholds and no-knock warrants. And strict standards and transparency around the use of force.
413,Only @BetsyDeVosED and her team of former #4profit college hacks could take sick joy in making life harder for struggling veterans and defrauded students. https://t.co/O5XI7ylEag
414,"Nine of the 10 hottest Julys have happened since 2005. In MA, that means rising sea levels that threaten communities, warmer waters that threaten our fishing industry, and drought &amp; monster storms that threaten our health &amp; safety. The #climatecrisis is here – we must act now. https://t.co/KTC9b5sZab"
415,"At least 27,000 meatpacking workers have contracted COVID-19 &amp; over 90 have died. But plants not only failed to implement worker protections as people got sick – they fought for an executive order to stay open &amp; waivers to put more workers on the line. https://t.co/c5g4TjTXEA"
416,Meatpacking companies used the COVID-19 pandemic – and the threat of shortages – as cover to jack up prices &amp; endanger workers while they exported record amounts of pork &amp; other meat products abroad. @SenBooker &amp; I are opening an investigation. https://t.co/WhYPe3ZfVc
417,"I’m puzzled why the Senate HELP Committee held a hearing today on “the next pandemic” when cases of COVID-19 are still rising now. We must expand contact tracing, secure our supply chain, protect communities of color, &amp; stop pretending that this pandemic is over. https://t.co/8yfmxnY4lY"
418,Massachusetts has some of the world's best hospitals and even they are still struggling to get PPE. This is ridiculous. Congress should pass my bill with @JanSchakowsky to publicly manufacture COVID-19 supplies &amp; deal with these shortages now. https://t.co/f93jziQVeP
419,Jared Kushner &amp; his cronies wasted a huge amount of time &amp; resources with this ineffective vanity project. Air Bridge was the Trump administration at its worst and why I've asked @COVID_Oversight to investigate. https://t.co/O93Nyw3vpo https://t.co/BVIb90sGZV
420,"OSHA has completely abandoned workers by refusing to issue emergency COVID-19 safety standards, investigate safety complaints, and issue citations. I’m glad @DOLOIG will audit @OSHA_DOL, which I requested last month, so we can hold the agency accountable. https://t.co/OZVy2lzz1w"
421,"Over 120,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Cases are still rising in over 25 states. And not having enough testing has made this crisis worse. We need to know if the President or his political team have undermined efforts to contain this virus."
422,Trump’s comments about slowing down COVID-19 testing were disgusting. They're even worse if his cronies listened to him. We want @OIGatHHS to review all @HHSGov programs related to COVID-19 testing to see if anything was slowed down by political pressure. https://t.co/7OyfxFQHab
423,"After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, Trump insisted that only dozens died when, in fact, 3000 did. @NydiaVelazquez &amp; I fought for an accurate count. Trump wasn’t making a sick joke about slowing COVID-19 testing. He stops counting to avoid accountability. https://t.co/AOa8K1V9dF"
424,"120,000 Americans are dead from the worst pandemic in a century, &amp; the President said tonight that he slowed down testing so the public death toll wouldn't be worse.

We still don't have a national testing strategy &amp; Trump's plan is to bury his head. This is a deadly failure."
425,COVID-19 is disproportionately killing Black &amp; Latinx Massachusetts residents. @RepPressley &amp; I are fighting hard for this data nationwide to get more testing &amp; treatment to communities of color &amp; address the systemic racism that worsens these disparities. https://t.co/IHFW1b7i7X

428,A veteran who lived in an independent living facility leased from the Bedford VA went missing for a month before his body was found on the property. His family deserves answers. I led a MA delegation letter asking @VetAffairsOIG for an investigation. https://t.co/V9rBQxLeGu
429,"The White House’s COVID-19 decisions should be driven by science, not personal profit. That includes Dr. Slaoui and Marc Short. Congress must pass my CORE Act to end the conflicts &amp; #StopCOVIDCorruption in the federal government’s pandemic response. https://t.co/VPqeKS5obr"
430,"I’m fighting alongside @DomesticWorkers so everyone can access COVID-19 testing, treatment, &amp; relief benefits, regardless of immigration status. And I’m fighting to #ProtectEssentialWorkers so domestic workers have the equipment &amp; protections to do their jobs safely."
431,"70% of Black immigrant domestic workers who provide critical care for families have lost their jobs or had hours reduced during this crisis. Many fear getting sick, being evicted, or being punished for seeking assistance. We need to fight for them. https://t.co/kw773gAUZS"
432,"If you’ve attended a march, protest, or other large gathering in the past few weeks &amp; want to get tested for COVID-19, Massachusetts has free testing across the Commonwealth today &amp; tomorrow. Learn more here: https://t.co/mWEdH4iSy7 https://t.co/yT7136otyx"
433,"The White House ignored the threat of COVID-19 until it was too late to stop it, left states without the equipment to fight it, &amp; didn’t track its spread to contain it. Now they want to wave a magic wand &amp; declare ""Mission Accomplished.""
 
Wake up &amp; get to work, @VP Pence."
434,"And if @VP Pence is bored, he could find out why @CDCgov still has huge gaps in its race &amp; ethnicity data so we make sure our federal response is reaching Black &amp; Brown communities hit hardest by this crisis. This shouldn’t wait until the August deadline. https://t.co/9kvXH0qXce"
435,"We need more COVID-19 tests, more PPE, &amp; a vaccine – &amp; a federal government that can distribute them at scale. Which is why Trump &amp; @VP Pence should be using the DPA now &amp; championing my bill to publicly manufacture COVID-19 supplies. https://t.co/XmNue8wKTJ"

438,Coronavirus keeps spreading across the country. Hundreds of Americans are still dying every day. And Dr. Fauci confirmed to me last month that another wave of coronavirus is “inevitable.” @VP Pence shouldn’t be celebrating – he should be making a plan. https://t.co/17hobwZyEi
