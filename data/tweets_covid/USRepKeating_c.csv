0,But I am not discouraged - because the fight for equity did not die tonight. The fight to protect a woman's right to choose did not die tonight. The fight for healthcare access did not die tonight.
1,"Every year, members of Congress receive thousands of pieces of mail. But I am among the few who have ever delivered it. https://t.co/d4scbXm7wx"
2,We knew this day would come - healthcare and economic experts predicted it - and that's why the House passed the HEROES Act nearly three months ago and sent it to the Senate.
3,"Americans, through no fault of their own, continue to face economic devastation as a result of the ongoing pandemic four months after the CARES Act was signed."

6,This waiver will allow boats and their crew to continue their work as a critical component of our domestic food production system without fearing exposure to COVID-19.
7,"UPDATE: I am pleased that NOAA has now decided, albeit at the last minute, to extend the waiver for At-Sea Monitors until August. COVID-19¬†has disrupted huge segments of our economy, and it has had a particularly severe impact on our fishing community."
8,"More importantly, family members of those who lost their lives as well as the troops now serving and their families deserve no less. (11/11)"
9,I am again calling on NOAA and the Trump Administration to protect the health and safety of our fishing community by acting to extend the suspension before it expires tonight.
10,I remain concerned that At-Sea Monitors are set to return to fishing vessels tomorrow after a March 24 emergency action by NOAA suspended the requirement to protect the health and safety of fishing crews.
11,I trust medical professionals. And the professionals agree: abortion is health care. Today's Supreme Court decision reaffirmed that states cannot force people to overcome substantial obstacles to access basic medical care.
12,The policies in H.R. 6 outline how we must treat those who only know this country as home and look to our country for protection. Offering safety and security for those in need is the American thing to do.
13,"Dreamers are a valuable part of our society. They are first responders, healthcare professionals, teachers - they are our friends and neighbors. Many if not most know no other home than this country. And they deserve to be treated for what they are - Americans."
14,"The Trump Administration's cruel, misguided decision to block path to citizenship for Dreamers who came to our country as children by no choice of their own has been struck down by SCOTUS. This was the only just outcome - an example of our system of checks &amp; balances at its best."
15,"Until today's ruling by SCOTUS, Americans in 17 states could be terminated by their employers because of who they are or who they love. Today is a landmark day for equality as SCOTUS has ruled that LGBTQ+ Americans are protected from discrimination in the workplace. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà"
16,We are in the midst of a global pandemic &amp; recession - I truly can't imagine a crueler moment for the Trump administration to turn their back on our transgender neighbors by stripping them of protections from discrimination at homeless shelters and their health care providers.üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
17,A passenger was removed from my flight to DC this AM for refusing to comply with airline mask policy. Kudos to flight crew and @MassStatePolice for handling the situation with true professionalism. Masks aren‚Äôt a values or political statement - it‚Äôs to protect those at risk.
18,Chag Sameach and a happy and healthy holiday to all those celebrating Passover.
19,"In a time of national health and economic emergency, the Secretary of the Interior should be reaching out to help all Native American tribes."
20,"On Monday, President Trump told Governors to do their best to procure their own supplies and not wait for the federal government. However, when Gov. Baker tried to buy supplies for our Massachusetts Hospitals, the federal government outbid the state and took the supplies."
21,"On Wednesday, President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act ‚Äì but now he‚Äôs stalling on using it to produce ventilators, masks, and other vital medical supplies."
22,I am calling on President Trump to take immediate action to harness the power of the Defense Production Act and put Americans to work making the lifesaving items that health care providers need to save lives ‚Äì without delay.
23,Our offices are handling constituent inquiries via telephone only until further notice. Please call 1-800-870-2626 if you require assistance. The best and most accurate information on COVID-19 can be found on the CDC‚Äôs website at https://t.co/2qhXnhxSHH

25,"We have so much to be thankful for. If you're lucky enough to be spending today with friends &amp; family, please take a moment to think of those who are not so fortunate, including our troops stationed around the world giving up a holiday to keep us safe at home. Happy Thanksgiving!"
26,"We must never forget the dark chapters of American history marked by democide, relocation, and other cruelties toward the women and men who were here long before European settlers took their land. #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth"
27,My prayers are with the families of the lost crew of the F/V Leonardo and the New Bedford fishing community today. Thank you to the heroes at USCG Air Station Cape Cod who recovered the sole survivor and continued the search around the clock with CGC Escanaba and CGC Cobia.
28,Change happens through leadership. We wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation right now ‚Äì our witnesses would be safely and happily in school pursuing their dreams and not protesting and pushing their governments to act ‚Äì if everyone was already doing their part. #ClimateCrisis
29,"My grandmother, who I often share stories about, was one month shy of her 40th birthday when she was finally entitled to cast a vote for President."
30,"This racist attack on my congressional colleagues does not serve to ‚ÄúMake America Great‚Äù. America has been made great by those who have come to our country and fought in our wars, cured diseases, and taught our children. https://t.co/uaVpHkgHyL"
31,On Friday I attended the ribbon cutting of @OuterCapeHealth's new Wellfleet community health center where I was able to share the news that my amendment passed with bipartisan support. #ProtectOurCare #HealthCareWeekend
32,"Since the start of our Congress #ForThePeople, @HouseDemocrats have been working to improve health care for all. This week I passed an amendment to provide funding for community health centers across the nation to follow the model put in place by @OuterCapeHealth. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Bz3BEb3E2q"
33,Today marks Holocaust Remembrance Day - a day where we remember the six million Jews and millions of others who died simply because of who they were. We must recommit ourselves to never allowing such a global tragedy to occur again by focusing on peace and understanding.
34,"While corporations and the wealthiest are getting a good amount of money back in their pockets, the people who have given the most for this country are bearing the burden of the Trump tax cuts."
35,"As a former District Attorney, the more I digest of the Mueller Report, the harder it is to swallow: 

‚ùåThat we can believe a presidential press secretary who admits under oath that she lies to the American public;"
36,"As a former District Attorney, the more I digest of the Mueller Report, the harder it is to swallow: 

‚ùåThat we have an AG who represents the public as opposed to one individual;

‚ùåThat the Russian attack on our democracy and the subsequent investigation were hoaxes;"
37,Withdrawing from NATO would create one of the most dangerous security voids of our lifetimes serving only to empower those who would strive to weaken the United States and undermine the world order the we have spent the last half of the twentieth century building with our allies.
38,I am proud to join on as a co-sponsor of #HR8 today and stand with all survivors of gun violence whose lives might be different had we had smart gun laws already in place.
39,"I had only been in Congress for 5 days when @GabbyGiffords was shot while meeting with constituents. I hadn‚Äôt had the chance to get to know her yet, but I immediately learned from other Members who knew her well what a committed legislator and thoughtful colleague she is."
40,"2,170 people whose names were in the Terrorist Screening Database were encountered at U.S. airports in 2018. 2,265 people on this list purchased firearms between 2004 and 2015. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/OJotM3v72I"

43,"Born in Massachusetts, President Bush was a Navy man who dedicated his life to public service, and he was one of the most distinguished experts on foreign policy in our history. After his Presidency he was a respected and moderating voice on important issues facing our nation."
44,"As a former District Attorney who has worked with victims of sexual assault, I realize the excruciating and retraumatizing nature of sharing the type of experience Dr. Ford has disclosed. I cannot begin to understand doing that on a national stage."
45,"L‚ÄôShana Tova to all who are celebrating today. May your new year be happy, healthy, and sweet."
46,"I visited with Chief Dunne and his officers this morning and was relieved to hear from him that both injured officers are expected to recover, and one was released from the hospital last night. Thank God."
47,"Every Member of Congress ‚Äì Democrat, Republican, or Independent ‚Äì who stands by silently after today is complicit."
48,"Today, the President of the United States stood next to the person who directed an attack on our country and instead of standing tall for America, he blamed us and our past leadership for Russia‚Äôs aggression."
49,"We see the pictures of terrified children separated from their families on newspapers across the country.

62,"When asked about the State Dept. last year, Trump said he is ‚Äúthe only one that matters"" on foreign policy. As long as he believes that, the country is ill-served regardless of who is Secretary of State."
63,It's outrageous that my Republican colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee stand completely at odds with our nation's top intelligence agencies who concluded Russia attacked our election system to help Donald Trump. Partisanship has trumped patriotism.
