274,"Congress should also pass my Taiwan Assurance Act, which states that “attempts to exclude Taiwan from international organizations are detrimental to global health” and advocates for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the World Health Assembly."
275,"The World Health Organization must allow Taiwan to participate in the May 2020 World Health Assembly, as well as in any emergency meetings regarding the Wuhan virus."
276,"The Chinese Communist Party has shamefully blocked Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Assembly for years. As the Wuhan virus spreads, Beijing’s petty attempts to deny Taiwan’s place in the world may have deadly consequences:

277,The Chinese government has a history of covering up the spread of diseases—w/ deadly consequences. I sent a letter to @SecAzar today urging HHS to report to Congress if it believes any Chinese government information about the virus is false or misleading. https://t.co/hMC07YRWv5
278,The CCP is once again keeping the world in the dark about a deadly outbreak. This harmful approach will only ensure the virus spreads further. Beijing must be fully transparent starting now to prevent this from becoming a pandemic. https://t.co/KlWTzwfjaI
279,"In the past, the CCP has lied, falsified statistics, and suppressed information about outbreaks in order to cover for its own incompetence. The SARS virus killed nearly 800 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide after the CCP denied there was even a health crisis."
280,"Once again, a deadly virus is emanating from China. Hundreds have fallen ill in Asia and at least one confirmed case has reached the United States. It’s imperative that the CCP be fully transparent and share information so we can stop this disease from spreading."
281,"If Democrats want to constrain the president’s ability to kill terrorist masterminds like Soleimani, they should have the courage of their convictions &amp; block spending for the brave troops who carried out the strike instead of introducing unconstitutional war powers resolutions. https://t.co/93jq9a1BoK"
282,Happy to see we’re returning to the time-honored definition of ‘joint employer.’ This change is a victory for any Arkansan who enjoys the convenience of local franchises. https://t.co/XzmviRiTfo
283,"But the brave people of Iran are not fooled. They have no illusions about the evil men who rule them. As they yet again take to the streets, God bless them and their hope for a better future."
284,Thank you to all the law enforcement officers in Arkansas and across the country who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay
285,"A leopard can’t change its spots, &amp; Tehran won’t change course overnight. They’ll continue using proxies to fight their battles. But they can’t hide—we know who their proxies are, and the United States will remain vigilant in the defense of our citizens and allies in the region."
286,"Qassem Soleimani masterminded Iran’s reign of terror for decades, including the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Tonight, he got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice. https://t.co/1wkjtvj2QA"
287,On this Christmas Eve please join me in praying for Bryant Police Officer Samantha Hodgson who is currently in stable condition. Thank you to the brave law enforcement officers who pursued this suspect for all you do to keep us safe. https://t.co/QrHhbzoAPJ
288,"The true number is higher because California refused to report any data. This year, DC joined the conspiracy of silence.

Americans deserve to know the truth."
289,"First, the good news. The abortion rate has fallen by more than 25% between 2007-16 in the states that consistently report to the CDC. 

Slowly but surely, the pro-life movement is winning. More parents and babies are enjoying the gift of life.

https://t.co/EvDiWcHY5U"
290,"The CDC recently released new data about abortion in America. It contains good news and bad news, but the data are incomplete because pro-choice states like California don’t cooperate.
 
I have a bill w/ @SenJoniErnst to fix that.

291,"All fallen officers will be remembered as heroes. In Arkansas especially, we’ll remember Officer Stephen Carr of Fayetteville, whose watch ended on December 7th, 2019. May he rest in peace. https://t.co/gO6Nv7MBqE"
292,"Stephen Hacala Jr. died from an opioid overdose because of a dangerous gap in our nation's drug laws. Now, anyone who sells unwashed morphine-laced poppy seeds will face the full force of the law and can no longer hide behind legal technicalities. https://t.co/HP41FBImJS"
293,"The Global Hostage Act would punish foreign hostage-takers by:

—Revoking and denying visas to the US for them &amp; their families

—Blocking their financial transactions in the US

—Allowing Congress to order reviews of foreign hostage-takers who should be sanctioned"
294,"Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate regime &amp; his Cuban backers continue to hold six American oil workers hostage. These Americans are being held in Venezuela’s most notorious prison, wasting away like so many normal Venezuelans who suffer under Maduro’s rule. https://t.co/kqSPFTSYHO"
295,"The Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad captured an Arkansan and humanitarian, Majd Kamalmaz, more than two years ago. He hasn’t been heard from since. I recently had the opportunity to meet with his family, who are vigorously advocating on his behalf. https://t.co/xyVKM9q7ZB"
296,No foreign official who imposes hardship &amp; loss on American families should have a family who can benefit from our open society. My bill would punish those who hold Americans hostage by sanctioning their assets &amp; blocking their travel to the United States. https://t.co/ecXbIVWcCA
297,RT @KleptocracyIntv: LIVE NOW: @SenTomCotton joins @Doranimated at @HudsonInstitute to discuss his plan to sanction foreign officials who f…
298,"Arkansans want to help their fellow man, but their assistance should be taken in good faith. That means if you’re receiving food stamps &amp; you can get a job, you should. Strengthening work requirements ensures that aid goes to Americans who truly need it. https://t.co/aF8gL7Dnem"
299,"A white supremacist has been on death row for decades after murdering an Arkansas family, including a young girl. He’s spent years trying to thwart justice, and now he has help from a liberal judge in D.C. who halted his execution. https://t.co/bL5OwKCsu1"
300,A district judge in Washington just issued an opinion halting the execution of a criminal who committed a brutal murder in AR &amp; was sentenced by juries of his peers. He spent years exhausting every avenue of due process. It’s time for justice to be served. https://t.co/zhsAAS7r28
301,"The mullahs are playing with atoms in an underground bunker at Fordow instead of helping their own people, who are demonstrating in the streets. The administration’s decision to revoke the Fordow sanctions waiver &amp; keep maximum pressure on the regime in Tehran is the right call. https://t.co/vhhXU8yjEr"
302,"Non-citizens who assault and rob Americans should be deported, not released on a technicality. My bill eliminates the ""catch and release"" loophole and would keep violent non-citizens in federal custody until they’re sent back to their home country. https://t.co/jjF00FbgMd"
303,It was an honor to speak to the veterans who came out to MacArthur Park in Little Rock today to celebrate and thank all of our nation’s brave servicemembers. https://t.co/wTJlC5tps6
304,There's no better time than Veterans Day to honor those who left our shores only to be held captive and those who have still not returned. I introduced this bill because prominently displaying the POW/MIA flag will help remind all Americans of their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/U1Rff5Acei
305,Chinese “exit bans” are kidnapping and should be treated as such. Any Chinese official who holds innocent Americans against their will ought to be sanctioned. My Global Hostage Act would make those sanctions mandatory. https://t.co/hmnuPYIJip
306,"If a foreign official takes an American hostage, travel to the U.S. shouldn’t be up for debate. The Global Hostage Act would deny U.S. visas to such officials &amp; their families—including Iranians who send their children to American universities. https://t.co/dgqZgCxRzo"
307,"If you’re in the business of kidnapping Americans, you shouldn’t be able to send your kids to our universities or take lavish vacations here. My bill punishes those who hold Americans hostage by sanctioning their assets &amp; blocking their travel to the U.S. https://t.co/xyv4E6apjq"
308,"ISIS slavemaster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead thanks to the brave men, women, &amp; K-9s of the U.S. military.
