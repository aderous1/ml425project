1,"You cannot defeat a pandemic if you cannot accept that a pandemic exists. As new cases spiked to record highs, the White House on Tuesday listed “ending the COVID-19 pandemic” as Trump's top scientific achievement. You can't wish away the problem. https://t.co/8yqWICUNeY"
2,"The president’s chief of staff said, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” The reason we can’t control it is because of the failures of this administration to take it seriously. This is a lack of leadership that has failed the American people. https://t.co/0PNi6hE3a0"

6,Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell has again rejected a coronavirus relief bill based on what the House and White House are calling for. His obstruction and unwillingness to compromise is hurting Americans who desperately need relief. https://t.co/qXUAeQtB3W

9,"A far-right Supreme Court could end the Affordable Care Act and throw our entire healthcare system into chaos. All those who rely on protections for preexisting conditions, the Medicaid expansion and so much more would be devastated. We can’t accept that."
10,"Make no mistake, an extremist majority on the Supreme Court could easily destroy the Affordable Care Act. Preexisting conditions would lose coverage. Medicaid expansions could be gutted. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be a humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/fFoD5FaQku"

19,"I am deeply disappointed, yet unsurprised, by the administration’s continued refusal to be candid with the American people, and their refusal to protect others—from staff to reporters and Secret Service officers. They need to take the virus seriously, on all levels."
20,"Last week's jobs reports are a grim reminder that we cannot return to normal until the virus is contained, and we cannot delay direct assistance for the American people. The House repeatedly passed sweeping packages. Sen. McConnell must end his obstruction!"
21,"Right now, we have to unite, and do everything possible to defend the ACA from radical and undemocratic GOP legal assaults. I continue to look to a future, though, where we can truly guarantee #MedicareForAll. Healthcare is a human right."
22,"QAnon is a toxic movement. The FBI has clearly identified it as a threat to national security, linked to violence. Every American should condemn it. Proud to support my colleague, @RepMalinowski and to pass H.Res  1154 to repudiate this vile conspiracy theory."

41,"$600 UI payments have been a lifeline for millions of families who lost jobs, and who could not safely return to the workforce. The evidence is clear that cutting these benefits does not boost employment. President Trump and the GOP are clearly wrong. https://t.co/QnWrlcNolJ"
42,"The Senate GOP has made it clear that they’re unable to pass a Covid relief package. There’s only one option left. They must accept the Heroes Act now—to guarantee sweeping economic relief for the American people, and for our communities."
43,The administration is suppressing evidence of the threat of white supremacy. They’re hiding evidence of Russian interference. The president has tried to hide the threat of the pandemic since February. These are astounding failures of duty. We must hold them accountable.
