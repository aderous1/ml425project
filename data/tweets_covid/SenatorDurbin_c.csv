1,".@SenDuckworth &amp; I have blocked USDA’s overreach for 2 years. Now—in the middle of a pandemic—they're trying again. This time, USDA seems to be breaking commitments made to me in Congressional testimony. We will stand up again to this senseless effort &amp; protect these Illinoisans."
2,"IL runs a leading program to help 8,000 seniors &amp; people w/disabilities access health &amp; nutrition services in their community, rather than an institutional setting. Despite two decades of this program, the Trump Admin has tried to rip away SNAP benefits that feed these groups."
3,The ACA protects millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. But Republicans want SCOTUS to strike it down &amp; rushed a new justice to the Court to help. We can't return to dark days of higher costs &amp; less care for sick patients. I’ll keep fighting to save the ACA.
4,"Spoke earlier this week with @IDPH Director Dr. Ezike about the surge of COVID-19 cases in IL, racial disparities, and our PPE &amp; testing capacity. I promised Dr. Ezike to keep urging my Republican colleagues to finally join Democrats in crafting a comprehensive relief package."
5,"As COVID-19 cases in IL surge to record levels, it is straining our health care system. I was briefed by hospital officials from Chicago to Carbondale &amp; Quincy to Danville about PPE &amp; testing needs, &amp; to let them know I am doing everything I can to bring federal aid home to IL."
6,"From the outset, the President and his team misled the public, downplayed the virus &amp; refused to follow the science. The consequence? 74,000 new COVID-19 cases yesterday alone. Hospital beds filling up. 226,000+ Americans are dead. They have not “ended the pandemic” in any sense. https://t.co/jd3NDMRCKl"
7,"From start to finish, Republicans disregarded the COVID-19 pandemic in their rush to confirm Judge Barrett before Election Day. All the while #COVID19 cases spiked across the US.
 
They gave up on helping the American people to pursue a partisan power grab. Shameful."
8,"Pres. Trump has been clear that he wanted Justice Barrett on the Court to help him in election challenges. Democrats asked Justice Barrett at her hearing to commit to recuse herself from cases involving the ongoing election, and she refused. This left a cloud over her nomination. https://t.co/E6x87zvam0"
9,"Sen. McConnell spent 5 straight days on the Senate floor jamming through the Barrett nomination. Five days for a partisan power grab. But no time for meaningful, bipartisan #COVID19 relief. His priorities are crystal clear."
10,"Justice Kavanaugh &amp; his conservative allies last night disenfranchised Wisconsin voters whose ballots are mailed before Election Day but arrive after. Voter suppression is alive and well in the GOP.
 
It’s clear that we must enact my Constitutional guarantee of a right to vote."
11,This is a dark day for the Senate. Republicans have defied rules &amp; traditions in their rush to confirm Judge Barrett in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic &amp; an election. I believe my Republican colleagues will regret the consequences of taking us down this path.
12,"I will be voting against Judge Barrett’s nomination tonight. More than 225,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 &amp; more than 60 million ballots have already been cast in the election that is just eight days away. This is not the time to be pursuing partisan power grabs."
13,"Adding Judge Barrett to form a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court is a direct threat to Americans’ access to affordable health care, voting rights, reproductive rights, marriage equality, &amp; more. I will vote no on her nomination because I know #WhatsAtStake."
14,"RT @peoplefor: Health care. Voting rights. The right to privacy and choice. Civil rights. Environmental protections. Workers' rights.

15,"225,000+ Americans are dead &amp; Trump Admin has surrendered to COVID-19. The GOP-held Senate refuses to work with Democrats on relief.

17,"Just because Republicans hold up a scrap of paper &amp; call it a relief bill, doesn’t make it one. Not a cent for hospitals, stimulus checks, rental assistance. In their rush to confirm Judge Barrett &amp; eliminate health care, Rs have abandoned needs of Americans during this pandemic. https://t.co/ZZJC5RkwQL"
18,"Senate Republicans have made it clear: their priority is not to pass a bipartisan pandemic relief bill, but to confirm their Supreme Court nominee instead. Meanwhile 225,000+ Americans have died from COVID-19 and the pandemic rages on. The Republicans’ priorities are all wrong. https://t.co/4CfYApdop6"

24,"If Judge Barrett is confirmed, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose health care protections. Women could lose the right to choose. And millions of Americans could lose the right to marry who they love.
 
That is what's at stake."
25,"How long can Senator McConnell ignore the fact that COVID-19 cases are spiking across the US? The Senate should be working around the clock on a comprehensive bipartisan relief bill.

26,"COVID-19 cases in IL are surging to record levels. Please think about your neighbors, your loved ones, and our health care heroes. Basic, selfless steps like wearing a mask and distancing can save lives."
27,Glad to see my bipartisan Due Process Protections Act with @SenDanSullivan signed into law this week. This bill will protect the right of federal criminal defendants to all evidence that could exonerate them and hold accountable prosecutors who fail to disclose this evidence.

30,"Pres. Trump has made it clear: he wants Judge Barrett to rip the ACA’s health care protections away from the 100+ million Americans with pre-existing conditions, during a pandemic.

33,"Judge Barrett’s record is full of red flags when it comes to LGBTQ rights. If she is confirmed, the right of Americans to simply be who they are and love who they love is at risk. Marriage equality is at risk. We can’t take that chance—I’m voting to #BlockBarrett."
34,"A flawed, broken process to rush a SCOTUS nom.

The future of so many critical rights &amp; protections is in jeopardy.

In my place in the Judiciary Committee today was a photo of Kenny from Tinley Park, IL, who depends on lifesaving care thanks to the ACA. This is what’s at stake. https://t.co/fFWRnaKfd3"
35,"If Congress doesn’t come together to pass meaningful #COVID19 relief soon, this recession is only going to get worse. More people will lose their jobs and more businesses will fail.
 
Senator McConnell may be prepared to accept that, but Democrats are not. https://t.co/5qMpekvSeE"
36,"We're in the midst of serious epidemic &amp; it may get worse. The American people need real economic relief &amp; a plan to stop the virus. But sadly, Sen. McConnell’s partisan #COVID19 relief bill was a symbolic, political measure that did not go nearly far enough. https://t.co/hFFuR0FK1b"
37,Senator McConnell’s “skinny” #COVID19 bill was a purely symbolic effort to allow vulnerable Republican Senators to go home &amp; say they voted for something. This flawed measure was never intended to actually pass. The American people deserve better. https://t.co/mvg5iqA4MB
38,"Here's all the proof you need that Senator McConnell does not care about stopping the virus or supporting our small businesses &amp; families. The American people can see right through this cynical &amp; selfish political maneuvering.  
https://t.co/C3utHpDiQO"
39,The Trump Admin’s plan to set the lowest refugee resettlement goal in history is a shameful betrayal of our nation's bipartisan tradition of generosity &amp; strength. We can do much more to provide safety to innocent victims of war &amp; terrorism who pose no threat to our security.
40,"More than 100M Americans live with a pre-existing condition. One of them is Nate from Montgomery, IL.
 
Nate was diagnosed with biliary atresia at 3 months old. If Republicans eliminate the ACA, he could lose access to the health care he needs to survive.
 
I'm fighting for Nate. https://t.co/D89ogkxmu1"
41,"Senator McConnell’s partisan #COVID19 relief proposal is half-hearted &amp; half-inspired. It doesn’t do enough to stop the virus, help workers, or support families. Its sole intention is providing political cover for vulnerable Senate Republicans who have failed their constituents. https://t.co/7h61Pdn85T"
42,"Congress needs to pass meaningful #COVID19 relief to help stop the spread of this virus &amp; support struggling workers &amp; their families.

Instead, Sen. McConnell wants to pass a bill that protects big corporations from accountability. The American people can see through this sham. https://t.co/jDfPDxCC7n"
43,Senator McConnell isn’t serious about passing meaningful #COVID19 relief. His “skinny” bill that we’re voting on later this week doesn’t even have the support of the White House.

46,The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted to facilitate investment in marginalized communities after decades of redlining &amp; discriminatory lending practices. The Trump Admin. is gutting the CRA—in the middle of a pandemic &amp; economic crisis no less. Congress must act to #SaveCRA.
47,"The Affordable Care Act provides protections for more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. That includes cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, depression &amp; COVID-19.
 
We can’t let Republicans take those protections away."
48,"A 6-3 right-wing Supreme Court is a threat to health care, to a woman’s right to choose, and to the right of Americans to love who they love. Republicans know this, and they are doing everything they can to rush Judge Barrett’s confirmation. Americans see where they stand."
49,"For months now, Senator McConnell has repeatedly refused to work with Democrats on #COVID19 relief. Now—all of a sudden—he wants to pass a small, symbolic gesture right before the election.

51,Pres. Trump was clear: he wants Supreme Court justices who will help him end the Affordable Care Act. Judge Barrett’s hearing did not reassure us that the law is safe. Will two more Senate Rs stand up for Americans with pre-existing conditions &amp; oppose this rush to confirmation?

363,Today in East Peoria I discussed the continued need to take COVID-19 seriously. Everyone needs to wear their mask and keep social distancing to help combat this pandemic and save lives #AllInIllinois
364,.@SenateDems are announcing a plan today to help communities of color respond to the pandemic &amp; build lasting wealth. Our Economic Justice Act will direct untapped #COVID19 relief funding towards addressing systemic racism and historic underinvestment in communities of color. https://t.co/rlACHX8GkG
365,The Trump strategy on record breaking #COVID19 infections and fatalities in the U.S.: silence Dr. Fauci and conceal medical data from the CDC. A pitiful strategy to mislead the American people. https://t.co/77tMAjGMck
366,"Spoke with IL reps of veterans service organizations yesterday about ensuring that our veterans have continued access to medical care, VA benefits, and other important resources during the #COVID19 crisis."
367,"Due to flaws in @HHSgov's allocation formula, hospitals like Mt. Sinai in Chicago—one of the largest safety nets—did not originally receive these funds. Glad to see @SecAzar take my advice &amp; provide these crucial health providers w/the funds they need to keep fighting COVID-19."
368,"When I spoke to @SecAzar last month, I pressed him to fix the grant process &amp; provide more funding to rural &amp; safety net hospitals on the front lines of COVID19. On Friday, @HHSgov announced it will award $4B in new funding to these hospitals, incl. more than $100M for Illinois."
369,"Amazing work from the team at @LaRabida, collecting more than 100,000 diapers for families in need across Chicago, all while caring for their medically complex patients during COVID-19. Great to see the community come together to help one another. #RaisingPossibilities https://t.co/o0SC4zQU7F"
370,"This should be a call to action. As of May, 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance as a result of this pandemic, right when they need it most. That’s why I’m working in congress to help people keep their employer health plans—even if they lose their job—at no cost. https://t.co/T5m2IWJQ25"
371,"The same “very stable genius” who suggested we inject Lysol is now asking us to choose between his medical expertise and that of Dr. Anthony Fauci? If “Dr. Trump” is our last line of medical defense, say your prayers, America. https://t.co/raXddhb7yK"
372,Glad to be back in my hometown of East St. Louis yesterday to discuss the #COVID19 pandemic response. I will keep pushing for additional federal assistance to assist in the economic recovery.

374,Subjecting international students to deportation if their colleges choose to pursue full-time online coursework this fall due to #COVID19 is cruel. I'm joining 98 lawmakers in calling for the immediate reversal of this unnecessary policy. https://t.co/SH4h5HbI03
375,"Great to speak w/ @ILBizImmigrant about ensuring that #COVID19 relief programming is accessible to immigrant communities. Immigrants continue to treat #COVID19 patients, run businesses, &amp; study in the US, &amp; I'll keep fighting to secure their legal &amp; financial protections."
376,"The Supreme Court's ruling to further limit the ACA's provisions to require coverage for birth control is detrimental to women's health &amp; reproductive rights. Women, not their employers, should be the ones making decisions about their health care. https://t.co/9ZUTolbkwN"
377,"In the midst of a global pandemic, President Trump announced plans to withdraw from WHO. When we need to learn and work with other nations to fight this public health crisis and develop a vaccine, the President lets his colossal ego overrule common sense. https://t.co/LddZtZ9caD"
378,"As the U.S. continues to see a rise in infections, President Trump’s retreat from WHO &amp; the global effort to combat COVID-19 is a short-sighted mistake. The U.S. should not turn its back on the international community to find treatments and vaccines that we all desperately seek. https://t.co/BH1KAKxvAQ"
379,This is devastating. My heart breaks for those mourning loved ones who were hurt or killed this weekend. Too many innocent young lives have been tragically lost to this scourge of gun violence. https://t.co/oqwfmqEhSy

382,"This health &amp; economic crisis has bruised our economy &amp; left many families without a steady income. I'm partnering w/ @SenSchumer, @RonWyden, &amp; @SenDuckworth to intro legislation to ensure struggling workers continue to receive increased unemployment benefits."
383,"Today, I pressed @NIHDirector and @CDCDirector to ensure any vaccine is proven safe, effective &amp; free from political influence."
384,Proud to have supported @NIH with funding to research a #COVID19 vaccine. But the President’s conspiracy theories and anti-science behavior raise concerns about the integrity of the development &amp; approval process. We must build confidence that we are not cutting corners. https://t.co/Qi8EkeTWsk
385,"The US is up to 50,000 new #COVID19 cases in a single day now. Some experts believe that number will soon reach 100,000. If Sen. McConnell doesn’t feel the urgency to act now, when will he?

386,"Hard to imagine how the President can celebrate job #'s knowing that the US just hit 50,000 new #COVID19 cases in a single day for the first time.

395,The Trump Admin is moving full steam ahead with efforts to dismantle the ACA &amp; rip health care away from millions in the midst of a global pandemic. Today @SenateDems introduced a resolution condemning this effort &amp; asking DOJ to defend the ACA during this public health emergency https://t.co/GUL3gb4SES
396,"As COVID-19 cases spike across the country, Sen. McConnell’s top priority has been confirming judicial nominees instead of responding to this crisis. We need another relief effort ASAP. @SpeakerPelosi passed the #HeroesAct 6 weeks ago. It’s time for the Senate to do the same. https://t.co/HFVTrfBTtt"
397,Dr. Manuel Bernal’s parents brought him to the US when he was only 2 years old. Today he is working in one of the busiest trauma hospitals on Chicago’s south side. His story tells us a lot about why we must provide #Dreamers with a path to citizenship. https://t.co/BraZlwXy3o
398,"American service members deserve a Commander in Chief who will respond forcefully if bounties are put on them by enemies of the United States.
 
President Trump's response has been praise for Vladimir Putin and rewards for the Kremlin. He is failing our troops. https://t.co/jHP8VR3uFZ"
399,"The Affordable Care Act protects Americans with pre-existing conditions from discrimination. 

With over 2 million (and counting) already diagnosed with a new pre-existing condition—#COVID19—President Trump wants to abolish the ACA and offers no protection for their future."

412,"In the midst of a global pandemic, it would seem that asking the U.S. to join other countries in searching for therapies &amp; vaccines is just common sense. Last month, I introduced a resolution to reaffirm our commitment to this global effort despite the President's inaction."

414,"We should all agree that whoever the Attorney General is, he or she should be subject to independent oversight. Our bill fixes a glaring loophole in the law. Sen. McConnell should bring it to the floor for passage. 
https://t.co/NrkGGwzNut"

417,"During a global pandemic, the last thing our President should be doing is attempting to rip health insurance away from millions of Americans. Yet, that is exactly what President Trump did last night when he asked the Supreme Court to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/Zdg6ws2Eqx"

425,"Just yesterday, the U.S. recorded its 3rd highest coronavirus case count since this pandemic began.

This decision defies common sense. https://t.co/u1AR8eoj7o"

438,It would be an American tragedy to deport #DACA recipients who are saving lives in the midst of this pandemic. We cannot afford to lose these talented young immigrants. And we must give them the chance they deserve to become American citizens.
439,"President Trump should change course and protect #DACA recipients by:
 
1. Publicly announcing that he will not make another attempt to repeal DACA; and
 
2. Directing DHS to reopen DACA to eligible individuals who have been unable to apply due to his decision to terminate DACA."
440,"More than 200,000 #Dreamers—including 41,700 health care workers—are on the frontlines of the #COVID19 pandemic.  Now that #SCOTUS has rejected Pres. Trump’s repeal of #DACA, we must ensure these essential workers are not sidelined &amp; deported to countries they barely remember."
