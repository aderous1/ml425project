I talk to experts about my plan to expand this successful model.

4,"Color me shocked.

Democrats in major cities rapidly turned the radical slogan of ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù into actual policy and are surprised by the backlash of people who just want safety in their communities.

Less police means more crime. It‚Äôs that simple.

5,"Democrat leaders have repeatedly blocked COVID relief for small businesses, unemployed Americans, and a country still struggling through this pandemic.

34,"The left argues that shutting down the economy again is the only solution to address the spike in COVID cases.

CA‚Äôs spike in cases is as bad as Texas, even though their lockdown was longer"

41,"A few key stats today as we are facing COVID-19 in Houston

Daily hospital growth rate is just .2% down from 5.2%, just a week ago 

We are still in ‚ÄúPhase 2‚Äù of our ICU surge capacity plan. 

Just 9% of our Phase 2 capacity is full

Phase 3 is not expected in the next two weeks"
42,"Politicians have blamed a rise in cases across the country solely on reopening the economy. It‚Äôs their justification for calling for total lockdowns.

But as Dr. Shah explains, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlayering effect‚Äù that‚Äôs causing the uptick. We need to recognize this as we look for solutions. https://t.co/aw7lwFgdsu"
