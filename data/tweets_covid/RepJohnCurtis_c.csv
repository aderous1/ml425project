5,"Are hospitals overwhelmed?
""Referring to actual beds, we have them. The limiting factor is healthcare providers, esp. high-level ICU care w/only so many providers to go around...We all need to really think about what more we can do as individuals to limit transmission."" -Dr. Dunn"
6,"""We need to change mindsets about what's reasonable activity during a pandemic, esp. when hospitals are overwhelmed. To get our case counts down, we need to only socialize w/people in our households, wear face coverings when we're out &amp; stay home when we're sick."" -@DrAngelaCDunn"
7,It was a mental hurdle to start wearing a mask to the grocery store and out in public. The mental hurdle we all need to cross is wearing a mask around our loved ones too-- that's where most of the new cases are coming from.
