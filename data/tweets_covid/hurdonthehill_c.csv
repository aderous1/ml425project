1,"I wish the President, First Lady and all Americans battling Covid-19 well and a speedy recovery.
 
Covid-19 has always been a real threat to lives everywhere. We must wear masks &amp; take precautions. 
 
Thankfully America has the best and the brightest providing medical care."
2,"What happened to Jacob Blake is unbelievable. We must prevent officers who can or will use violence from being on the street, on the force. Dpts. &amp; all levels of gov't must make changes.
But violence won't give Jacob use of his legs or prevent this from happening to someone else."
3,"No one should be shot in the back repeatedly. 

Watching Jacob Blake get shot makes me sick. 

I cannot fathom how his kids felt. 

Thank God he is alive. 

I support a thorough investigation into this and the firing of any police who use such brutal, violent tactics."

5,"The US Postal Service is vital. They provide prescriptions, absentee ballots, a method to pay bills and so much more to the American people, and they’re doing this throughout the pandemic. They are essential, and, like always, I will continue to support them."
6,"By providing additional funds for state &amp; local governments to update &amp; secure their IT systems, we are enabling governments to help folks recover from COVID-19 &amp; advance once the pandemic is history. We must bring this infrastructure into the 21st century.https://t.co/c0gD6fXxPI"
7,"Every industry is going to be impacted by artificial intelligence &amp; whoever masters AI is going to master the world. @USAA and @UTSA are leading the way in #SanAntonio, but we also need a national plan for the U.S. to lead.

Now, they are retaliating because they got caught. https://t.co/TLsYcH6bbp"
10,".@NBA @UFC &amp; @MLB have thorough processes to screen players &amp; coaches, including tests every day, but some suggest teachers and school kids just wash their hands &amp; stay home if sick. 

How about we value teachers and kids the way we do the athletes we enjoy watching on TV?"
11,"After chats with teachers, I’m afraid reopening our schools will be a debacle—I hope I’m wrong. 

Instead of threatening to withhold funds, Dept of Ed should be working with states and school districts on how to EXCEED @CDCgov protocols."

16,"The qualified immunity doctrine shields officers from liability for official acts. This protection seems sensible, but in some cases shields abusive officers.
 
We need to clarify this law to ensure officers are held accountable for violating civil rights. https://t.co/Ah6uO2JhRa"
17,The murders of law enforcement officers in recent days are outrageous. Anyone who kills police officers should be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
18,"Let's focus our anger on this problem until it is fixed, so we can truly honor the black men and women like George Floyd who have been murdered."
19,"There’s international unity behind holding the @WHO accountable and improving it so that it’s more effective in the next major public health crisis.

https://t.co/MNZgGotERl"

138,"To my colleagues condemning this decision: the Iranian regime is the culprit, not the victim. They are still the world's top state sponsor of terrorism and have killed hundreds of thousands, including U.S. troops and over 1,500 of their own people for peacefully protesting."
