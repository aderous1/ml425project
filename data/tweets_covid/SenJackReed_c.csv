1,"Amidst the hardship of #COVID, it’s heartwarming to see people doing their part to protect the health &amp; safety of others. This virus has reshaped many things, but it hasn’t changed our shared values or the basic goodness of people. Thanks to all those making a difference!"
2,"COVID is keeping us apart, but the only way to effectively combat it is by working together. We must each do our part. Please #WearAMask. Please take proper #COVID precautions. I know #COVIDFatigue is real, but the virus is spreading &amp; we all need to step up to help save lives."
3,"Instead of passing #COVIDrelief, Senate Republicans rushed to the WH to clink #SCOTUS champagne flutes &amp; then skipped town. But not before scheduling the 1st vote of the #lameduck session on… wait for it… a judicial nominee. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/YnprtDs0QY"
4,"When a #COVIDvaccine is ruled scientifically safe, it should be FREE for all Americans.
Trump Admin initially was going to let #redtape force some seniors to pay.
I intro'ed the Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for Seniors Act (S. 4825). Now Trump Admin is reversing course."
5,"QUESTION: Why are Senate Republicans rushing this process &amp; putting 1 person's #SCOTUS nomination above the health &amp; welfare of the nation?
 
ANSWER: https://t.co/GHXPbzI6oF"
6,Make no mistake: Tonight’s #SCOTUS vote isn’t about 1 individual. It's about the GOP jeopardizing #healthcare for 20 million+ Americans during a pandemic. It's about eliminating protections for 100M+ Americans with #preexisting conditions. We must #ProtectOurCare.
7,"Heading to the Senate floor to oppose the #SCOTUS nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett &amp; condemn this rushed, irregular process - undertaken in the midst of a pandemic - that wrongly prioritizes 1 person’s lifetime appointment over the health &amp; welfare of the American people."
8,"SMOKING GUN PROOF: Pres Trump is rushing an extreme, lifetime #SCOTUS nominee (w/ help of Senate GOP) to terminate the #AffordableCareAct. Ripping away people's healthcare in midst of a pandemic will harm public health &amp; further destabilize the economy. https://t.co/4uCKWQBCaA"
9,"The U.S. Senate must help combat #COVID; deliver relief for struggling families, biz &amp; communities; &amp; turn our economy around.
Instead, GOP leaders chose a lifetime job for 1 extreme #SCOTUS nom. over #publichealth, the health of our economy, &amp; the needs of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/eImNNwYp81"
10,"Outrageous. After 5 months of inaction, Sen. McConnell scheduled a #showvote on a cynical ‘skinny’ #COVIDrelief bill that is completely inadequate. The American people deserve solutions, not stunts &amp; backroom double-dealing.

11,"There are certain things all RIers share: a (401) area code, a love of good food, &amp; knowing how to navigate using landmarks that no longer exist. 
Another thing we should all have: access to affordable health care. #AffordableHealthCare is on the ballot this Nov. #ProtectOurCare"
12,"Good news for helping people in crisis: Last night, Pres Trump signed into law a bill I co-authored to designate 9-8-8 as a nat'l #suicideprevention &amp; #mentalhealth crisis hotline. @800273TALK remains accessible 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). New 3-digit number will take effect in 2022."
13,RT @SenWhitehouse: 21.1 million Americans will lose their health coverage if the Supreme Court strikes down the ACA. #WhatsAtStake
14,Having #healthinsurance can be the difference between life &amp; death. The Trump Admin is suing in federal court to get #SCOTUS to strike down the #ACA &amp; eliminate critical health protections for millions of Americans. We must #ProtectOurCare. The best way to do that is to vote.

19,"With a pandemic raging, #SCOTUS let Pres Trump end the #2020Census early. Pres Trump doesn’t want an accurate count. He thinks an incomplete count will help him &amp; GOP politically. It’s cruel &amp; wrong. The only way to overcome it is to #GetCounted by Oct 15.
https://t.co/MfDLsq5ANo"
20,"Families, small businesses, &amp; jobless Americans are struggling to pay bills. Instead of providing them robust relief, Pres Trump is thrashing around trying to provide himself political cover. He can’t even agree w/ GOP leaders &amp; is not serious about a #COVIDrelief bill."
21,"Proud of my 100% score on @cleanh20action #CleanWaterScorecard. Clean water &amp; a healthy environment are essential resources we can't do without. I pledge to keep pushing to support science, protect our environment, &amp; address the very real threat of climate change."

25,"If #POTUS can get #COVID, then anyone can. COVID is still rampant. Other nations have effectively contained it, the U.S. has not. We're lagging due to lack of presidential leadership. Willful ignorance is not a strategy, it's a dangerous Rx for more infection &amp; prolonged crisis."

28,"Dark days ahead if Senate GOP &amp; Trump Admin continue blocking comprehensive, bipartisan #COVIDrelief. New @wapo story exposes rising rate of unpaid utility bills &amp; threat it poses. That’s why I’m working to boost #LIHEAP &amp; create a #HousingAssistanceFund.
https://t.co/Ox2bJ5CqzZ"
29,"The battle to #ProtectOurCare impacts ALL Americans, regardless of where they get their #healthcoverage. Republicans want to put insurance companies back in charge &amp; return to days when insurers could charge more, limit care, &amp; deny coverage to people w/ #preexisting conditions."
30,Sen. McConnell has led 30 votes to kill the #AffordableCareAct &amp; 30 times he’s failed. Now he wants to rush through a #SCOTUS nominee whose 1 vote can take away #healthcare from 20M+ Americans &amp; eliminate protections for 130M+ more. That isn't democracy. Americans deserve better.
31,I’m working to prevent the Trump Admin from taking away people’s #healthcare. @SenateDems are forcing a vote tomorrow to block A.G. Barr from using taxpayer dollars to support Trump’s lawsuit to overturn the #AffordableCareAct (#ACA). Urge the U.S. Senate to #ProtectOurCare!
32,"As we work to contain #COVID, we must also stop the spread of #disinformation that threatens public health. Intro'ed new bill w/ @maziehirono &amp; colleagues to provide $1 million booster shot to help immunize American public from false &amp; misleading info &amp; trace the spread."
33,"Congress must swiftly investigate Trump Admin’s misuse of $300M in #CDC funds that could have gone to helping #COVID patients &amp; developing a vaccine, but was instead diverted to a wasteful, self-promoting propaganda campaign.
