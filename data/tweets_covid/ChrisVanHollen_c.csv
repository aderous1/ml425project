And so much more.
 
It can all come down to one vote. Your #VOTE . https://t.co/0fv8vrEmRw"
1,"Right now, federal law requires states to seize child support payments from the lowest income families receiving certain social services. Our bill would reverse this policy, investing in our children and ensuring child support actually works for the families who need it most. https://t.co/Db0qBRDnIK"
2,"The president got world class care at Walter Reed. That’s fine. What’s reprehensible is his lack of care for others—including Helen Avalos, a worker at Walter Reed, who shared how his gross indifference has affected her and others who contracted COVID.
https://t.co/tEgp6izvYC"
3,"After Trump turned her swearing-in ceremony into a political campaign rally, it’s more important than ever that Justice Barrett recuse herself from any election-related cases that come before the Supreme Court.
 
She says she’s independent.
 
Show us."
4,"I just voted NO on Judge Barrett. In 8 days, Americans will render a verdict on the gross abuse of power we have witnessed in the Senate time and again. They will never forget how the GOP ignored their needs during the COVID-19 crisis. This is not over. https://t.co/V45YE2UA7v"
5,"RT @SenateDems: COVID pandemic
Job security
Racial injustice
Climate change

Instead of facing these challenges, Senate Republicans are jam…"
6,"Overturning the ACA would set our country back in the fight to tackle racial health disparities. I'm here with @WesMoore and Maria Gomez, the head of @MarysCenter, to talk more about #WhatsAtStake with the ACA and Judge Barrett’s nomination. https://t.co/3Lo5mOSGIM"
7,"Trump is uncomfortable with career civil servants who pledge loyalty to our country, not to him personally. This would destroy a merit-based system that rewards expertise, not political cronyism. We must and will stop this abuse of power.
https://t.co/Kz4MFaO6oE"
8,"Despite strong objections from the American people, Republicans have pushed Barrett’s nomination through the Judiciary Committee. The next step is a full Senate vote. Health care, voting rights, gun safety, and reproductive freedoms are all #WhatsAtStake. https://t.co/VYlqEl8o6s"
9,"Our bill makes the payroll tax deferral optional. People like Amy from Havre de Grace, who called my office to share the problems this creates for her household budget, shouldn’t be forced into Trump's scheme. Let Amy and others decide what’s best for them.https://t.co/QkoiHYnFa0"
10,"We have over 215,000 Americans dead because Trump refused to follow the recommendations of Dr. Fauci and our health care experts, and now he is calling them “disasters” and “idiots”?  Another day of Trump, another bad day for America. https://t.co/FDWI17KmY0"
11,"The Clean Water Act passed 48 years ago. We know that access to clean water is essential to public health, environmental justice, and thriving communities. We must ensure a clean Chesapeake Bay and protect all our waterways from those who refuse to hold polluters accountable. https://t.co/Cch4QJ3mof"
12,".@SecPompeo, you've repeatedly told Erdogan that Turkey’s testing of the Russian S-400 is unacceptable to the US &amp; NATO. Now he's again thumbing his nose at you and the President. When are you going to follow the law and apply bipartisan CATSAA sanctions? https://t.co/dwxVzWxplT"
13,"Discussed with @SenSherrodBrown #WhatsAtStake for seniors’ health care if Judge Barrett is confirmed. For the 46 million Americans participating in Medicare Part D, striking down ACA means those with the greatest needs will have to pay up to nearly $4,000 more for prescriptions. https://t.co/3mBmOyVcA0"
14,"We’re in the midst of a global pandemic and millions of Americans are out of work, and Trump’s big idea for a second term is to cut the corporate tax rate by 1% to make it a nice round number. We need to help workers, not put more money in the pockets of billionaires. https://t.co/GuyzWIzbeZ"
15,"Since Republicans are using baseball analogies, here’s one for them: Why would a team recruit a star player who didn’t have a batting record they liked? Trump says he wants a justice who will overturn the ACA and Barrett’s ""stats"" show she’s game. What’s difficult to understand? https://t.co/AgwE0Ejq9u"
16,Who serves on the Supreme Court matters. Lifting the stay allows Trump to continue his political games and end the Census early. Today we see how a conservative majority can undermine an accurate count and rob states of millions in their fair share of federal funding. https://t.co/OUvUywClC8
17,Talk about illegitimate Court-packing. Trump couldn’t destroy the Affordable Care Act thru the democratic process—survived by 1 vote. So now—with the virus raging and millions having voted—GOP wants to kill it with 1 vote in unelected SCOTUS. Contempt for voters and their health.
18,"I hope everyone has made their plan to vote. For any Marylanders who are not yet REGISTERED to vote, you still have time—the deadline is this TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13th. Please make sure you and everybody you know is registered to vote. Here’s how: https://t.co/C17buJh5g0"
19,"175 years ago today, the @NavalAcademy was founded in Annapolis. The choice to serve our country comes with great responsibility, sacrifice, and honor. Our leaders at the highest level should always respect those who serve our country—and support our troops every step of the way. https://t.co/jO3UxWNEB2"
20,"If true, it’s time for CDC Dir. Redfield to resign in protest of this political interference in a key health matter &amp; explain his decision to the public. That would show support for the CDC professionals AND focus public attention on the need to wear masks.https://t.co/U2R2620a7p"
21,"Much like COVID-19, asthma disproportionately impacts communities of color. Baltimore has one of the highest asthma rates in the nation. The GOP’s efforts to destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions will worsen this environmental injustice. #WhatsAtStake"
22,"We need comprehensive relief, and we’ve been trying to get this done for nearly 6 months. But Trump and McConnell would rather push through a SCOTUS nominee that will rip health care away from Americans and raise prescription drug costs. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/cSFHPajsVH https://t.co/GSEnDnuW3m"
23,"The White House's secrecy and lack of serious response to its COVID-19 outbreak is endangering workers and their families—many of whom are Marylanders. We need answers about what steps are being taken to protect White House workers, including Secret Service and support staff."
24,"To sum up Trump’s position: Stop efforts to help America defeat COVID-19 in order to focus 100% on putting someone on SCOTUS to destroy the Affordable Care Act and take away health care protections from Americans. Not what the public is looking for.
https://t.co/DmRfppnFwW"
25,Over 100 days since reports of Russia offering bounties for the murder of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and still no response from the Trump Administration or plan to hold Russia accountable. Joined with patriot @SenDuckworth to say: those who serve deserve so much better. https://t.co/WfzwS7s33S
26,"Trump now says “I get it” and he has “learned a lot” at “the real school.” Tragically, it is too late for the nearly 210,000 Americans dead and more than 7.4 million infected with COVID-19. And he still doesn’t get it—endangering those around him for political theater. https://t.co/ubuJ8tLGr9"
27,"Low wage workers are hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis. The House’s original Heroes Act, and the new relief bill passed by the House last night, supports these workers and families with the $600/week UI boost and nutrition and rental assistance. McConnell, allow a Senate vote! https://t.co/5txZQdIHqi"
28,"I wish the President, the First Lady and their staff, and the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are currently infected with COVID-19, a full recovery. The virus can reach every American and following CDC guidelines is essential. No one should mock those who wear masks."
29,"The police shouldn't have to handle every crisis. We must build alternative response capabilities to stop criminalizing poverty, substance use disorders, and mental health conditions. The first step? The Community-Based Response Act, which I introduced today with @RepKarenBass. https://t.co/wceLPn4dOu"
30,"A very bad hair day: while teachers who buy supplies for their students are capped at a $250 deduction, Trump takes $70,000 for hairstyling? Hard to square with caring for the “forgotten people.” One of a zillion reasons Trump is so desperate to hide his tax returns. https://t.co/c9TerH9ABG"
31,"We are in a pandemic and should be working to pass a relief bill. Instead, Republicans want to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court to help them strike the Affordable Care Act, gut voting rights, civil rights, and take away every woman’s right to reproductive choice."
32,"By rushing to confirm Amy Coney Barrett before Nov. 3rd, Trump is not only refusing to hear from the American people but selecting someone who will try to dismantle the legacy of Justice Ginsburg. We will use every legal tool available to stop this abuse of power."
33,"Don’t let them tell you this isn’t about health care, it is. This has been their plan all along. Republicans are hellbent on nominating a Supreme Court Justice who will rip away health care from millions and raise costs even if it’s during a global pandemic! https://t.co/iVYrK47yJV"
34,"Make no mistake, Trump and McConnell are telling America that—in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis—their priority is to pack the Supreme Court with right-wing ideologues who will deny affordable health care to millions and rip away protections for pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/zwhmwkmKnh"
35,It’s totally unacceptable that the OCC wants to write a new rule that would allow predatory payday lenders to charge outrageous interest rates to already vulnerable consumers during the pandemic. Acting Comptroller Brooks must immediately withdraw this proposed rule. https://t.co/evLc2eNL7W
36,Looks like the guy who confuses the job of AG with being the president’s legal lapdog also can’t distinguish between the evils of slavery and life-saving health measures. Said it before but just for emphasis: Barr NEEDS TO GO now! https://t.co/eai0GyvLQA
37,"Cpl. Woodson was an American hero who never received the recognition he deserved because of the color of his skin. For years, I’ve worked alongside Mrs. Woodson to obtain full recognition of her husband’s valor. @RepDavidTrone and I are asking Trump to get this done immediately. https://t.co/Sen6T5V9xD"
38,Dark money groups are about to surpass $1 billion in spending since the disastrous 5 to 4 Citizens United decision. The public has a right to know who is paying to influence their vote. Let’s get secret money out of politics and pass the DISCLOSE Act. https://t.co/mkh6WvDVzt

40,"Many TPS workers, all here legally, are on the front lines of our COVID-19 response. Today @SenatorCardin, @SenFeinstein, and I urged the Senate to protect them. This ruling makes it even more urgent to shield them from Trump’s inhumane deportation orders. https://t.co/BEVYEpdHS2"
41,"I'll be hosting a Telephone Town Hall tomorrow at 6:45 PM, joined by Dr. Harolyn Belcher. We'll provide an update on COVID-19 and take your questions on everything from reopening schools to progress on a vaccine. Register here to join: https://t.co/KU1jG5xepk https://t.co/0PGf4RZLeD"
42,"Anyone who thinks the Green New Deal is too “radical” should pay attention to the devastating wildfires on the West Coast, which are directly linked to inaction on climate change. This isn’t about politics—we must act now to save lives and our planet.
https://t.co/qc9DprliC8"
43,"We now know Trump knew this virus would be deadly but downplayed the risks, resulting in more deaths and economic harm. Now, McConnell refuses to provide meaningful relief and is penalizing schools for taking safety measures and giving millionaires tax breaks for private schools. https://t.co/boVk6BhraJ"
44,"As Election Day draws near, Marylanders should have all the information they need on the process for casting their ballot. As it stands, those who want to vote-by-mail in this election must return their application by October 20th.
https://t.co/xaYYydTssS"
45,"I stand in solidarity with the Capital Gazette staff, who are rallying today for workers and journalists. Now, more than ever, we must fight for a free press and for local news sources that inform us about what’s happening in our communities. https://t.co/BWCLPkCD8q"
46,"Once again Trump is using the military as props in his political schemes. He has said those who serve are “suckers” and now he wants to use them as pawns in his shell game. This should be a VOLUNTARY program, not MANDATORY. https://t.co/Or7NDZr799"
47,His emphatic denials only show he knows these revelations will hurt him. Who would tolerate as Commander in Chief someone who calls those who died in service to our country “suckers” and “losers”? https://t.co/0dFxVmrMQ1
48,"Despite statements by Maryland State officials that the backlog in the unemployment system has been cleared, we continue to hear from many Marylanders who haven’t received their benefits in 4+ months. We’re asking the state to immediately fix this problem. https://t.co/djEO3SMizB"
49,"In a rush to cut costs, @DeptofDefense is jeopardizing access to care for active-duty families and retirees. We're hearing from Maryland families who are concerned about these changes, especially during a pandemic. The Administration owes us answers. https://t.co/PoPA73FoqH"
50,"As many Maryland families continue to struggle with the economic hardship caused by the pandemic, we cannot let students go hungry. @SecretarySonny must continue to allow flexibility in school meal programs so our children have enough to eat. https://t.co/jmzuRYuruh"
51,"McConnell has turned his back on the millions of suffering Americans—including more than 350,000 Marylanders—who are at risk of eviction. We must pass #RentReliefNow and extend the eviction moratorium immediately.
https://t.co/WiVVsdqf90"
52,"It’s shameful that, as families struggle to stay afloat, some hospitals getting emergency federal funds are also seizing their patients’ wages to collect COVID-19 medical debt. Congress must stop this abuse by including our bill banning this practice in the next relief package. https://t.co/5sny735jWB"
53,"Deeply saddened to hear of the tragic loss of Joseph Kitchen—a bright light in the Maryland Democratic Party who was passionate and committed to the work of improving our democracy. He left us too soon, but his legacy of good works will stay with us. https://t.co/sdOnouzLe0"
54,"Instead of containing the virus, Trump is trying to manipulate the Postal Service to cheat in the election. As I said outside the Baltimore USPS Center today with postal workers, union leaders, and other public officials, we must act to end this abuse of power. #SaveThePostOffice https://t.co/aWzb0pM3aD"
55,"For Trump, huge handouts to big polluters are more important than protecting public health—even during a pandemic. Good thing @SenMarkey and I just introduced the METHANE Act, which will reduce large-scale emissions of natural gas and hold big polluters accountable. https://t.co/C3CrxpOrX5"
56,Trump’s executive sham on evictions doesn’t actually prevent a single struggling American from getting thrown out of their home and onto the street. All it does is ask HHS and CDC to “CONSIDER” the issue. That’s no protection at all. Pass the #HeroesAct! https://t.co/2XZTvJaxTX
57,"The virus isn’t on standby, the Senate shouldn’t be either. 

But it’s a ghost town here since Mitch McConnell sent home senators until further notice with no plan in place to vote on another relief package. 

Mitch, do your job, bring the full Senate back. https://t.co/9uZ99nX3p9"
58,"Three years ago, white supremacists stormed Charlottesville, killing Heather Heyer. Today we remain engaged in an ongoing fight against those in our country who seek to fuel hate and racial division. This centuries-old struggle is one we must win."

61,"Marylanders, if you haven’t, please fill out your #2020Census ASAP. I'm working to extend the Census deadlines, but we must get the word out. Every person not counted is $18K less over 10 years for our schools, transportation, health, and more.
https://t.co/mXZwV5FR9d"
62,"The pandemic is not taking a day off and neither should the Senate.

On the Senate floor to call upon McConnell and GOP to get out of their bubble and start doing their job. https://t.co/XPD39JaqBJ"

65,The pandemic has amplified the deep inequities that already existed in our education system—and transformed the homework gap into a full-blown learning gap in urban and rural communities. Senate Republicans need to join us in addressing these inequities. https://t.co/0NkVJDU83i
66,"Trump again abused his power to install the bigoted, conspiracy spouting Anthony Tata at the Pentagon. Trump demeans our country and insults our troops when he drives out patriots like Lt. Col. Vindman and rewards the likes of Tata. This cannot stand. https://t.co/zbMeuVb2Zj"
67,"Starting soon: my Telephone Town Hall with Dr. @kathleen_neuzil, a vaccine and infectious disease expert at @UMmedschool. We’ll update you on COVID-19 and the latest on the fight for additional federal relief. Listen live and ask questions here: https://t.co/KU1jG5xepk"

70,"Want to help save lives? Mask up. 

Teamed up with @SenSanders to introduce the Masks for All Act, which will ramp up domestic production of high quality, reusable masks for all and provide surgical masks and N-95 respirators to all workers in health settings. https://t.co/RGrcM7BY7q"
71,"In the middle of a pandemic, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger—who is supposed be a consumer watchdog—rolled back protections against predatory payday lenders. The Trump Admin’s $7 billion giveaway to payday lenders will hit workers when they are already struggling. https://t.co/eU06MuZCmS"
72,"Facts to put the GOP's priorities in perspective:

Over 40% of COVID-19 deaths were linked to nursing homes or long-term care facilities.

Targeted funding to help nursing homes experiencing outbreaks in the GOP bill?

74,We should never allow medical debts to ruin peoples’ livelihoods—but especially not as we face this pandemic. Teamed up with @ChrisMurphyCT to stop aggressive medical debt collection tactics like seizing patients’ wages and bank accounts.
75,Helping the millions of Americans who are about to get kicked out of their homes isn’t a “pressing need” but spending $1.75 billion to protect Trump’s real estate interests is? https://t.co/pCn4jQJcox
76,"Today, as I stood at his casket to bid a final farewell to a man who taught me, and our country, so many important lessons, I pledged not to rest until we, in the Senate, a short walk from where he lay, passed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/SWK87Kmyoz"

78,"To safely reopen schools, we need widespread testing.

Instead, Trump is letting billions of dollars Congress allocated for testing go unspent. 

He says he wants schools to reopen, but won't take the necessary steps to successfully do so. https://t.co/G5rHR3pwrg"
79,Congress spent years working towards a new FBI campus. Trump pulled the plug. Now he wants to exploit the next emergency COVID-19 bill to get the current FBI building renovated on the current site near the Trump Hotel. Not going to happen. https://t.co/WkahubXQvc

81,"The pandemic has turned the #HomeworkGap into a full-blown learning gap.

82,Many small businesses returned all or some of their PPP loan due to uncertainty—they shouldn’t be barred from re-applying now that terms have changed. We’re urging SBA and Treasury to clarify this for those in Maryland and across the country who need help now. https://t.co/Q8jD1pgw4e
83,"Mr. Vought was complicit in Trump’s corrupt scheme to extort Ukraine to interfere in our elections and the outrageous effort to cut CDC funds during a pandemic to pay for billionaire tax breaks.

So what did GOP just do?

Voted to put him in charge of OMB and the budget."
84,"Over 130,000 TPS holders work on the front lines of our country's COVID-19 response.

Trump's efforts to strip their status and deport them is unjust and stupid.

As I mentioned to grassroots activists this morning, we must keep fighting for protections like our SECURE Act. https://t.co/GoFna5o5Au"

Trump and Mnuchin decided to use taxpayer dollars to feed loan sharks who prey on workers and struggling families instead. 

Reprehensible. https://t.co/3JdeRYuTlJ"

99,"I’ve heard a lot of bad faith arguments against #DCStatehood, but the fact is this: There are 700,000 American citizens in our nation’s capital who can’t cast a vote for Congress. D.C.—with its own history, character, and culture—must be a state. https://t.co/3PbjVDtxfa"

330,Deepest condolences to the family of Officer TJ Bomba. We all owe a debt to him and the Maryland police officers who put their lives at risk every day to keep our communities safe. I am closely monitoring the situation in Silver Spring. https://t.co/s9mUM5WiqP
331,"Back in March, my friend Maryland State Senator Will Smith went to Afghanistan to work as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve. It was great to catch up with him while I was in Afghanistan last week, and I’m thankful to Will and all those who serve in uniform. https://t.co/hOxnyc3xPJ"
332,"Memo to @realDonaldTrump, @SecPompeo, and the @VP—Is this a joke? You just announced open-season for Turkish-backed fighters to attack ethnic and religious minorities in Syria. How will this 'protect' anyone from these thugs who are taking photos of their human rights violations? https://t.co/RpS39Ls7yD"
333,"This is one of the many terrible atrocities being carried out by Turkish-backed forces, who are committing war crimes. Trump stabbed our Syrian Kurdish allies in the back and has their blood on his hands.

Shameful time for the United States. 

Congress must act. https://t.co/r4xOjUxA7N"
334,"Growing up in the Foreign Service I witnessed the sacrifices and steadfast professionalism of America’s career diplomats like Ambassador Yovanovitch. 

We owe a deep debt of gratitude to all the civil servants who risk their careers to stand up to abuse of power. https://t.co/H5SB0pVqZz"
335,"So Trump wants to end “endless wars” by deploying 2,000 troops to protect Saudi oil while he withdrew a few hundred U.S. troops who were supporting the Syrian Kurds in the fight against ISIS, leaving them open to Turkish attacks and helping ISIS terrorists rebound. Beyond crazy. https://t.co/YYD2PeXbCR"
336,"Just sickening that President Trump is threatening civil servants, like the whistleblower, who are using legal channels to expose abuses of power. The one who is betraying our democracy and country is Trump.
https://t.co/E08LGsNHCO"
337,"If Senate Republicans aren’t seriously alarmed by this whistleblower report, then something is deeply wrong. This is about the future of our democracy and anyone who asks a foreign power to attack our free and fair elections should be immediately investigated and condemned."
338,"From attacking collective bargaining rights to silencing anyone who contradicts him, Trump has no respect for federal workers. Despite his attacks, we’ve refused to stay silent and have stopped many of his attacks. In the words of Dolores Huerta, “Si se puede!” Yes we can. https://t.co/EkSCaN2yVL"
339,"I’ve been a longtime supporter of #DCStatehood. After more than 25 years, the House held a hearing on this issue today. I stand with @MayorBowser, @EleanorNorton, and all of the 700,000 taxpaying residents who are fighting for equal representation in Congress. https://t.co/jw0StyVN61"
