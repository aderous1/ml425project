0,I wish the @POTUS and @FLOTUS a swift recovery from COVID-19. The Coronavirus is a very real threat that our nation is still fighting to overcome. We must all continue to do our part in keeping each other safe and healthy.

2,"FEMA grants have been made available to help American families and individuals struggling with lost wages due to COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, I call on Gov. Newsom to act swiftly in securing this critical assistance for the State of California. https://t.co/o5UM3fpwEL"
3,"Veterans are not a line item in a budget. They are human beings and, in this case, the bravest and most honorable among us. The Barstow Veterans Home represents our commitment to those who have served our country.

5,"We’re making progress in combatting COVID-19, but HR 6800 wastes precious time and money. Instead of working together to help American families &amp; small businesses, the House majority put forward an unfocused partisan bill that has no chance of becoming law https://t.co/XeQJ9WK9oC"
6,"During #NationalPoliceWeek2020 we recognize &amp; remember our brave officers who have fallen in the line of duty. In this time of uncertainty, our officers continue to put their lives at risk every day to protect our communities. Be sure to thank them for all they do to keep us safe https://t.co/tYUinAejAJ"

8,"My colleagues and I sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Congress intended for the COVID-19 funds provided to the State of California to be passed down, in part, to areas that didn’t receive money directly, not for the money to remain idle in Sacramento. https://t.co/ZbiftSm8eL"
9,My colleagues and I sent a letter to Congressional leaders addressing the lack of COVID-19 funds for small/midsize counties including @InyoCounty and @CountyofMono. We need to ensure ALL our counties have adequate resources. https://t.co/gHuG4YemBX

As Vice Chair of the American Sikh Caucus, I recognize that we must be vigilant and stand united against those who seek to divide us with prejudice and hate. Our country has no place for racism. https://t.co/Q3aQpq9b3w"
