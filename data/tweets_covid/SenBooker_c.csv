1,"In just 20 years, the US economy missed out on $16 trillion—that’s ‘trillion’ with a “t”—in economic output due to widening racial gaps driven by racism. We must do better—and we need a President who will champion policies that seek to push back against racial bias &amp; inequality. https://t.co/VlBehIhgGm"
2,We know that Donald Trump nominated Judge Barrett with a very specific agenda in mind. We know that Donald Trump wants the Affordable Care Act overturned—and that has very real &amp; harmful consequences for millions of Americans. Health care is #WhatsAtStake. https://t.co/kyLnCM1UIF
3,"In advance of the final vote on Judge Barrett’s confirmation, I spoke on the Senate floor about #WhatsAtStake for health care for millions of Americans, and also spoke about her troubling record on race and the law. https://t.co/Y5v14XTq9T"
4,"The rushed hearings revealed a nominee who:
- privileges the right to own a gun over the right to vote 
- will make it harder to seek equal justice under the law in employment discrimination cases
- couldn't speak to the extent of bias in our criminal justice system #WhatsAtStake"
5,"In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump &amp; Senate Republicans are continuing their fight to take away health care from millions of Americans. On November 10, SCOTUS will hear a case that could strike down the ACA. That’s #WhatsAtStake with their nominee—your health care."
6,Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act which expands health care to over 20 million and provides protections for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. That’s #WhatsAtStake. https://t.co/q6FLvAJ6Ip
7,This is not a normal process &amp; not a normal time. Our country is in crisis &amp; people need help—not a rush to confirm a nominee who does not reflect the will of the American people. I stand with my Democratic @SenJudiciary colleagues in boycotting this sham process. https://t.co/CPw28z6gui
8,"Nigerians are protesting abuse at the hands of police &amp; I stand with them. In order to be a vibrant &amp; respected democracy, the Nigerian government should protect the rights of peaceful protestors &amp; investigate the violence committed against them. https://t.co/7eQxpdiygA"
9,How can Donald Trump &amp; Republican leaders claim they support protections for people with pre-existing conditions while at the same time pushing for a lawsuit to eliminate them? They can't do both. That’s #WhatsAtStake right now with this Supreme Court nominee—your health care.
10,"If you’re one of the 8+ million Americans who got sick with COVID-19, you may now have a pre-existing condition. Thankfully, the ACA protects you—but the Trump-backed lawsuit on November 10 could take away your health care. That’s #WhatsAtStake with this Supreme Court nominee."
11,"When we’re this close to an election—in fact, when millions of Americans have already voted—the American people should decide who gets to nominate our country’s next Supreme Court Justice. That’s the precedent Senate Republicans used just 4 years ago."
12,"I agree with @SenBlumenthal—if this election is decided by the Supreme Court rather than the American people, the legitimacy of the Court and our democracy is on the line. If Judge Barrett is confirmed, she must recuse herself from any cases that could result from this election. https://t.co/HWM1SrPNse"
13,Let’s be clear: Senate Republicans are rushing this process in the middle of a pandemic &amp; an ongoing election because they've found a nominee in Judge Barrett who they know will do what they couldn’t do—subvert the will of the American people &amp; overturn the ACA &amp; Roe v. Wade.
14,Far too many couples were discriminated against for far too long because of who they love. Couples like Janice and Emily should not have to worry about their long fought for rights being taken away. https://t.co/FufOEgUQtM

18,"Nothing about this is normal. Nothing about this is right. Nothing about this is just. This election is ongoing. The American people should decide who gets to nominate our country’s next Supreme Court Justice. 

I will not be voting to confirm Judge Barrett’s nomination."
19,"In the middle of a deadly pandemic, in the middle of an ongoing election, Senate Republicans have found a nominee in Judge Barrett who they know will do what they couldn’t do—subvert the will of the American people &amp; overturn the ACA, overturn Roe v. Wade. That’s #WhatsAtStake."

23,"Let’s be clear: nothing about today’s hearing is normal. It’s not normal that @SenateGOP are rushing through a confirmation hearing, violating their own words all to ensure that millions of Americans will lose their health care in the middle of a pandemic."
24,At least two members of @SenJudiciary have recently been diagnosed with COVID-19—and we have no idea what kind of threat they or others pose to those around them today because they refuse to agree to mandatory testing.
25,"Today we are holding a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee, rushing through an illegitimate process, when we’re supposed to be working to protect the health and safety of Americans, and we can’t even do it in our own workplace—"
26,"#WhatsAtStake right now:
—Health care for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions
—20 million people losing their access to potentially life-saving care in the middle of a pandemic that has killed over 214,000 Americans"
27,On November 10—just one week after the election—the Supreme Court will start hearing a Trump-backed lawsuit that could tear down the Affordable Care Act. That’s why Senate Republicans are ramming through Judge Barrett’s confirmation—to take away your health care. #WhatsAtStake
28,"Donald Trump promised to nominate Justices who will “terminate” the ACA—and that’s what he has in Judge Barrett. In the middle of a deadly pandemic that has killed over 200,000 Americans, Trump is still trying to take away health care for millions. #WhatsAtStake"
29,"Two @SenJudiciary members have tested positive for COVID-19 while others have refused to be tested. Chairman Graham should not proceed with next week’s hearing without real safety protocols, including testing—this is a threat to those who work in the Capitol &amp; to public health. https://t.co/mw7DxLUyNL"

31,"The Supreme Court will hear a case on the Affordable Care Act one week after the election. If Trump’s nominee is seated, 23 million Americans could lose their health care. We can’t be silent as Donald Trump &amp; Mitch McConnell try to ram through their nominee. #WhatsAtStake"
32,We know #WhatsAtStake with this Supreme Court vacancy: millions of Americans could lose their health care including the 150 million Americans with pre-existing conditions covered under the ACA. We can’t be silent—we must speak out against this nominee and sham process.
33,We should be expanding voting rights—not making it harder to vote in a pandemic. So much is at stake right now including the right to vote. https://t.co/SYR3OQCoeq
34,"There are senators on the Judiciary Committee who are sick with COVID-19.
 
It’s reckless &amp; dangerous to public health for GOP leadership to rush a hearing for their SCOTUS nominee.
 
They’ve postponed voting &amp; other hearings in the Senate—this hearing should not be an exception. https://t.co/v15ZfGiM74"
35,"Three years ago, 60 people were killed in Las Vegas in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Today we remember the lives we lost—we must honor them by continuing the fight to end the gun violence epidemic in our country."
36,Senate Republicans just voted in favor of a lawsuit that would strike down the ACA which provides health care for millions of Americans &amp; protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Now they’re ramming through a #SCOTUS nominee to gut this law—we must fight.

40,"It’s been 5 months since the House passed the HEROES Act. Instead of focusing on urgent #COVID19 relief for American families, Mitch McConnell has prioritized rushing through an illegitimate Supreme Court nomination. Americans deserve better—we must bring a bill to the floor."
41,We must consider the possibility that election cases could end up before the Supreme Court. Should that happen—and should Trump’s hand-picked nominee Amy Cohen Barrett be confirmed—she must recuse herself from these issues. https://t.co/31I5nyEX33

357,"I’m here today because of the brave &amp; heroic activists on that bridge in Alabama 55 years ago, people who saw injustice &amp; refused to remain silent.

360,"Because there was a young lawyer named Arthur Lessman who had been sitting at home this day 55 years ago &amp; saw what happened to those protesters on the news. His conscience was awakened by their courage, so he decided to get involved in his own community in New Jersey. 4/"
361,I joined many of my @SenateDems colleagues to call on @DHSgov to stop immigration enforcement at hospitals &amp; medical facilities while #coronavirus continues to spread. People in this country should feel safe to seek medical care without fear of being deported. https://t.co/e9tLXOZDKP
362,"Grateful that Congress came together to pass much-needed funding to combat coronavirus.

With the 1st probable case in NJ, this funding is critical to those on the frontlines dealing with this threat—glad that funding I requested for state &amp; local health departments is included. https://t.co/wtBwjXbdHr"

🤒stay home if you feel sick…"
365,Over the weekend it was reported that roughly 2 million tweets spread conspiracy theories about the coronavirus in a coordinated effort. The objective is to muddle the facts and prey on vulnerable people. We need to know who is doing it and how we can stop it. https://t.co/PmIqtk7YgW
366,"Today SCOTUS heard arguments in a case that could end reproductive freedom in Louisiana &amp; will be consequential for states nationwide.

Natural hair like dreadlocks is a reflection of culture &amp; heritage. No one should be punished for expressing who they are. The CROWN Act would end this—hair discrimination is discrimination against black people. https://t.co/sA1xTDqq2M"
388,"Important point from @RepAdamSchiff: we’re here because of heroes like Amb. Marie Yovanovitch &amp; Lt Col. Vindman who risked everything to expose wrongdoing—people who put their country first.

394,"So many formerly incarcerated people face steep barriers to employment long after they’ve paid their debt to society.

402,"@itsgabrielleu These biases don’t just exist at work—they exist in society at large, where black people are told their hair is unkempt, dirty, and more. @jay_suth’s dreadlocks aren’t “awful,” they’re a representation of who he is.
