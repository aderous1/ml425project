Jail those who gave false Russian Collusion statements to feds! https://t.co/gUkwPtHv4Y"
212,"Aiden: Please suppress your greed &amp; envy of hard workers who produce what Americans buy. IRS: top 1% pay 37% of total income taxes, 37 times average. Why detest “rich folk” who pay so much?

The best way to reduce crime, lower tax burdens &amp; protect jobs and incomes for American families is by cooperating with Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement efforts to evict illegal aliens who thumb their noses at American laws. https://t.co/RIh2H7XivE"

Climate change extremists today shut down Washington, blocking roads with sailboats, chains, etc. Results: more air pollution from idling cars + angry citizens going to work, school, hospitals, etc.

A reminder of past climate change alarmist errors is good. Mo https://t.co/oLFoZkpA7n"
225,America often withholds or offers $ to “encourage” desired foreign govt conduct. Bush &amp; Obama froze Iranian $ to coerce desired conduct. It is one thing to accuse POTUS of illegal conduct.

SCOTUS reverses leftist California judges who ordered Trump Admin to consider &amp; approve improper asylum claims.
