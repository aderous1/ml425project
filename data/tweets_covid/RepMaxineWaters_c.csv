5,"#COVID19 is worsening! Infections are spiking across the country. The President has coronavirus &amp; he’s probably infected dozens of people in his circle! Republicans in Congress, how can you remain silent? You’re complicit by ignoring the lack of leadership during this crisis!"
6,"Of course we wish well all who are victims of #COVID19. However, we must call to account those who have ignored the advice of experts &amp; chose to endanger themselves &amp; others and thus become victims - that includes the President of the United States."
7,"I want to express my sincere condolences to the family of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a titan &amp; legend on the Supreme Court whose undeniably brilliant legal mind &amp; dedication to justice &amp; equality moved our country forward. We’ve lost a champion tonight, but her legacy lives on."

10,"Today, I’m also reminded of the courage of the heroes onboard #UnitedFlight93 who sacrificed their own lives to take control of the plane from terrorists so it could not be used as a weapon agnst their fellow citizens. They used their final moments in service to their country."

12,"I’ve never seen a more disgusting &amp; pathetic excuse for a human being than  Donald Trump! Several news orgs + Fox confirm Trump called US war dead losers &amp; suckers just like he called Sen. McCain! Trump is a con who only cares abt his next hustle! HE is the loser, not our troops!"
13,I’m heartbroken at the loss of #ChadwickBoseman. He was was a tremendous actor who brought  some of our community’s heroes to life. My prayers are w/ his family. His legacy will endure. Wakanda Forever! https://t.co/Yh7dXbdcjM

36,Now this President is attempting to discredit our top medical expert Dr Fauci! Trump is shameless! He will attempt to destroy anyone who disagrees with him or interferes with his political agenda. Let’s not let this happen. Let’s use all our social media platforms to crush Trump!
37,"Trump said 99% of #COVID19 cases are harmless. Trump is a 99% LIAR! First he called it a hoax, then told people to drink disinfectant; then he said it would disappear. Where are the masks, gloves, &amp; PPE? Everyone knows Trump is a liar. Ignore his advice! We’ll get him out in Nov!"
38,"The revelation that Trump denied support &amp; protection for American troops can be squarely placed on the shoulders of hardcore GOP Trump lovers who accepted his lies, his love of dictators, &amp; the disregard for the Constitution he’s demonstrated throughout his tenure."
39,"Trump still refuses to wear a mask. Trump’s FAILED leadership &amp; his unfortunate followers not wearing masks &amp; not social distancing is responsible for the growing infections, death, &amp; surge in #coronavirus cases."

57,"Instead of Trump instigating, threatening, &amp; being anxious to call out the military, he should tell the truth abt the number of people dying from #COVID19 &amp; ensure medical &amp; survival equipment reach hospitals &amp; clinics. Trump has failed on his duty &amp; responsibility to our country"
58,"According to the Constitution, Barr should be the people’s attorney, but he’s Trump’s lackey. Who would ever believe George Floyd’s family &amp; blacks will ever get justice from this racist president or anyone in his admin that he controls, including his majority on Supreme Court."

60,"Trump slammed Obama for playing golf after 2nd US Ebola case in 2014 &amp; today Trump was on his 2nd golf day as US approaches 100,000 #coronavirus deaths. Trump has implied COVID19 deaths may be his price for repairing the economy. He has no conscience! No empathy. No humanity!"
61,"Trump doesn’t care about the 80,000+ people who’ve died from #Coronavirus! He only wants to open up the economy so he can go back to having his white power pep rallies! The death &amp; economic devastation we are facing is b/c Trump failed to act early &amp; called #COVID19 a HOAX!"
62,"If pushing #Hydroxychloroquine wasn’t enough, Trump is now suggesting disinfectant &amp; ultraviolet light as a COVID19 treatment! Trump is endangering the lives of people who believe &amp; follow his advice! He needs to shut up &amp; be denied TV time w/ his unhinged cures &amp; remedies!"
63,Gov Kemp followed the advice of Trump &amp; his protestors &amp; “liberated” his state &amp; opened up the businesses that have the most personal contact w/ individuals in a state w escalating COVID19 sickness &amp; death. His actions will cause more infections. Stupid Kemp should know better!

71,"Take a chance. Remind an unmasked person to put on a mask &amp; if they become angry, smile and say “6ft away” &amp; keep going."
72,"The statistics &amp; data are emerging about #COVID19 racial disparities, including infections &amp; death. This Admin had better not play around w/a lack of testing, lack of sufficient PPE at hospitals in these communities, &amp; lack of support for the homeless &amp; healthcare resources."
73,"Why did Trump decide to defund drive-thru testing in the States, disadvantaging minority communities? Trump HHS reason was unless the states need it. What kind of question is that when testing is lacking all over w/ blacks &amp; minorities dying in huge numbers? We’re fighting back!"
74,Wow! Big $ GOP donor Mike Gula leaving his firm to sell medical supplies/PPE! Where is he getting the supplies &amp; how can he fill 100 million orders of masks when states can’t get them? What are his relationships? Will his PPE come from fed stockpile?
75,Would Trump dare use #coronavirus as an opportunity to reward big GOP donors &amp; place people in our country in a vulnerable position b/c the PPE hasn’t been available to the states? Very suspicious! Are these new GOP companies getting PPE from what Kushner called “our stockpile”?
76,Doing all I can to answer questions abt govt response to #COVID19. Over 19k people called in to my 1st #covid19 tele town hall &amp; &gt;15k people called in to my 2nd. Never hesitate to call elected reps or fed agencies to learn how govt is helping U during this crisis! U deserve info!

79,"Trump, you incompetent idiot! You sent 18 tons of PPE to China early but ignored warnings &amp; called COVID19 concerns a hoax. You've endangered doctors, nurses, aids, orderlies, &amp; janitors - all risking their lives to save ours. Pray 4 forgiveness for the harm that you're causing!"
80,"Trump, stop congratulating yourself! You’re a failure &amp; you've mishandled this #COVID19 disaster! You're not knowledgeable &amp; you don’t know more than experts &amp; generals. Your ignorance &amp; incompetence are appalling &amp; you continue to demonstrate that every time you open your mouth!"
81,"Trump, since you destroyed the WH unit designed to plan for pandemics like #COVID19, you need to stop being duplicitous about the DPA &amp; get more corps to develop masks, respirators, &amp; everything needed to protect hospital workers trying to save lives. Get your act together!"

84,"The Senate bailout bill must protect employees! There should be no firings, no layoffs, no cut in pay, no cut hrs, or diminishing health benefits/pensions. The bailout must not increase pay for CEOs, give bonuses, or allow for stock buybacks! America's workers MUST come first."
85,"Trump is duplicitous &amp; causes confusion every time he opens up his lying mouth! He claimed to invoke the Defense Prod. Act, but later said he was waiting for the ""worst case scenario."" How many more people have to get sick or DIE until Trump exercises the full power of the DPA?"
86,"Our hospitals are out of gloves, masks, gowns, respirators, protective shoe coverings, and basic supplies!  What the hell more is Trump waiting for? Hey stupid, this is the worst case scenario!"

89,Trump’s swipe @Yamiche is yet another attack on a woman raising serious ?s. Trump can’t stand being challenged by women but he’s especially disrespectful towards women of color. @PBS Yamiche’s question was legit. Why did Trump shut down pandemic office? Answer: Plain ignorance!
90,"It is shameful, disappointing, &amp; tragic that the greatest country in the world, the US, has only tested 14,000 people as opposed to S. Korea which is testing 20,000 per day. Trump, you must immediately reestablish the pandemic office you shut down to avoid future crisis failures."
91,"Rep. Nunes' latest rant, urging people to go out like there's no pandemic, should be ignored! He is one of Trump's biggest sycophants in Congress! Listen to health experts, @CDCgov, &amp; your local officials. Take #coronavirus seriously &amp; practice social distancing."
92,"Given the outrageous bureaucracy that denied many labs the ability to perform COVID-19 tests, the Administration should reassure the public by telling us how many tests are being done every day and by whom."
93,"I don’t trust Trump or his sycophants! Trump had been partying it up at Mar-a-Lago &amp; at all these places w/ people who now have #coronavirus! He should follow @cdc guidance and self quarantine for 14 days, just like the public is advised to do."
94,"Shout out to Judge Howell for blocking Trump’s rule that would’ve kicked 700,000 people off food stamps during a global pandemic! Trump shows us again he cares nothing about the least of these. Thank you @AGBecerra &amp; @NewYorkStateAG for leading the way. We must keep fighting!"
95,Thank you Judge Dannenberg for having the courage to speak out about the current state of the Court. Trump &amp; #MoscowMitch are destroying fed courts by installing judges who will reverse so much of the progress this country has made over the last 60 yrs. People better wake up!
96,"Now is the time for all of us to keep informed of all the coronavirus info on a daily basis. Listen to @CDCgov &amp; local health experts like @CAPublicHealth, wash your hands, avoid touching your eyes/nose/mouth, &amp; stay home if you’re sick."
97,The 4 pro career DOJ attys who investigated Roger Stone recommended 7-9 yrs incarceration b/c Stone is guilty of witness tampering &amp; lying. He is well known as a dirty trickster &amp; political terrorist. This is typical of Trump’s friends. Don’t be surprised if Trump pardons him!

120,Congressman Cummings is a true patriot who fights for Americans every day. He is not a liar. He is not a divider. He doesn't abuse women. Trump needs to understand that people know the difference between him and Congressman Cummings.
121,Testimony from the lawyers who worked with Mueller would be additional and supportive information about #45 and his obstruction of justice and collusion with Russia. We can't stop now. Let's go for it! Impeachment is the answer!

129,"Trump's campaign chair gave polling data to Kilimnik who was tied to the Kremlin. Manafort, Don Jr, Kushner, &amp; Flynn met w/ Russians during campaign. Collusion is obvious. Obstruction of justice is well defined in Mueller report. Trump said game over. No, the game has just begun!"
130,"Another strike against Treasury Sec. Mnuchin. Sears sued Mnuchin, claiming that he was among the board members who helped the CEO strip Sears of $2 BILLION in assets. Wow! Trump, his cabinet, &amp; his inner circle show up in so many fraudulent efforts! Are they all crooks?"
131,Barr made a point of defending the President by describing Trump's pressure &amp; frustration b/c of criticism. It's not the AG's job to protect a President who refused an interview by the Special Counsel! Barr is simply continuing his ongoing defense &amp; protection of the President!

140,"Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, &amp; the children need shoes. No American who works for our govt should be treated this way while you are living off the govt."

153,"#ConManDon is so quick to condemn athletes peacefully protesting police misconduct, but Trump said nothing when Roseanne Barr butchered our national anthem, grabbed herself, and spit on the field. ABC did the right thing. Now Congress needs to 'cancel' Trump."
154,"#ConManDon, you say it's Dems who are responsible for separating children from their mothers @ the border? Lies. You better locate the displaced children &amp; return them to their parents. Americans cannot live w/ this immoral atrocity."
