Her patients are among the 2.5 million Marylanders with preexisting conditions who could be denied coverage or face higher costs if the ACA is overturned. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/YqtCpAQRBD"
13,A reminder of #WhatsAtStake: The #ACA is a lifeline for Marylanders like Don. They shouldn't have to worry that they won't be able to afford the life-saving procedures they need because Republicans want to ram through their #SCOTUS nominee to take away their health care. https://t.co/jxCCxNCYpL
14,"The GOP proposal isn't enough. #SmallBiz &amp; their employees need more than just PPP to get through the pandemic.

28,"This is shameful. By halting funds for state &amp; local govts, schools, unemployment insurance, testing resources and small business support to push through his SCOTUS nominee, @POTUS is telling Americans that their health and stability are not his priority. https://t.co/FWjMEnI1T6"
29,On #WorldTeachersDay we thank all the educators who go above &amp; beyond to make learning possible - online &amp; in-person - for students through #COVID19. I'll keep fighting until Congress provides them with the resources they need to do their jobs effectively and keep our kids safe.

https://t.co/9vhZySZebM"
33,A majority of Americans think filling Justice Ginsburg’s vacancy on the Supreme Court should be done by whoever wins the election in November. We should not ram through a #SCOTUS nominee when Americans have already started to vote.

41,"Today we remember the nearly 3000 lives lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks 19 years ago.

We remember the first responders who ran toward danger to help others &amp;save lives.

We remember the heroism, bravery &amp; resiliency on the day that changed our nation forever. #NeverForget"
42,"The GOP's #COVID19 relief bill failed in the Senate because it failed to provide support for the families, small businesses and state &amp; local govts affected by the pandemic. We must work together to pass a bipartisan bill to respond to this national crisis.https://t.co/zju4dFdk4u"
43,"The Trump admin continues to push to reopen schools w/o investing resources to keep students and educators safe, w/o a national testing plan that would help our communities combat #COVID19. 

We can't put our kids and teachers at risk – we must continue to fight for their safety."
