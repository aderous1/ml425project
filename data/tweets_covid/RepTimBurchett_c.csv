33,"Representatives need to be in Washington and work for their constituents. Today's proxy voting measure is a bureaucratic power grab, requiring 20 members to pass a bill instead of 218. The House must adapt to #COVID19 and let Americans be represented by their elected officials."
34,"The House should be returning to Washington for committee hearings and routine business, not to vote on a liberal messaging bill that is going nowhere. 

Republicans are ready to work on a #COVID19 relief bill as soon as @SpeakerPelosi is ready to get serious about legislating."
