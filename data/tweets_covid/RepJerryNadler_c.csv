Please follow guidance from medical professionals and sign up for updates from my office https://t.co/x26t6A8WaP https://t.co/9Nc4GADclZ"
357,It’s important to ensure that you count all the members of your household in the #2020Census–regardless of immigration status or age. Here is a friendly reminder to make your whole family count from one of NY-10’s prominent residents: https://t.co/Uh9Zn7Tkbv
358,"Why is it crucial for all New Yorkers to participate in #GetCountedNYC? Because the #2020Census results will determine how NY federal programs are funded! The more people that respond, the more $$ NY gets for:
🟢schools
🟢hospitals
🟢trains &amp; buses
🟢housing
🟢highways &amp; bridges"
359,Congress must do everything in its power to limit the spread of this virus. That means voting for funds to fight coronavirus—which both I and @GOPLeader did—but it also means responsible leadership.

361,"Hey @GOPLeader: 

You know what'll help us keep Americans safe from coronavirus better than xenophobia? Paid sick leave, widespread access to free coronavirus testing, and protections against medical supply price gouging. https://t.co/WhJcNKpF2A"
362,"After six days, the lockdown at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has finally been lifted. Read my letter with @NydiaVelazquez to the MCC and the Bureau of Prisons demanding that all relevant documents and records be preserved. https://t.co/6bZJF8sO32"

366,"It allocates nearly a billion dollars to be used for the procurement of crucial medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, ensuring that health care professionals will be able to treat patients without fear of getting sick themselves."
367,"This package invests over three billion dollars into the research that will deliver a coronavirus vaccine and provides hundreds of millions more so that once those vaccines are ready, they’ll be affordable for the American people."
368,It supports the community health centers that have been on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus and reimburses the state and local governments that have already borne so much of the cost of our response.
369,"However, today’s vote is a necessary first step. The spending package will allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to areas that have already been hit by the virus, including New York."
