236,"Our farmers &amp; ranchers, who wake up every morning and *do their job* to help feed the world, deserve far better than the empty promises, unending delays, and excuses coming from House Dems. They need #USMCAnow. https://t.co/VE3kcHCRZM"

241,"The POW/MIA Flag Act is now law.
Our men &amp; women in uniform have valiantly chosen to serve in defense of our freedom &amp; security. Displaying a POW/MIA flag to honor those who haven't returned home is the least we can do to recognize these heroes &amp; the sacrifice of their families. https://t.co/kmuH9WOes5"
