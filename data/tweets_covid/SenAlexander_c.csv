77,"Even though COVID-19 has not, in general, hurt young children and college-age students nearly as much as older or more vulnerable Americans, there is some health risk. 

But in my view the greater risk is not going back to school."
78,Add to the casualties the teachers who weren’t prepared to teach remotely and the working parents who suddenly had school children at home and who weren’t prepared to home school.
79,Among the casualties of COVID-19 are the 75 million students who were sent home from schools and colleges in March.
80,"The US is in the middle of a very concerning rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in many states, and the experts in front of us today have told us that washing our hands, staying apart &amp; wearing a mask are three of the most important ways to slow the spread of the virus."
81,"If you want college football to return this fall, like I do, listen to @UTKnoxville’s Coach @phillipfulmer who told fans how they can help make that happen: “If you really, really want sports, football, and all those things, then wear a mask and keep social distancing.”"
82,That is why I have suggested the president should occasionally wear a mask even though there are not many occasions when it is necessary for him to do so.
83,"Unfortunately this simple lifesaving practice has become part of a political debate that says: If you're for Trump, you don't wear a mask. If you're against Trump, you do."
84,I’d like to say something about masks: People wear masks because the @CDCgov advise the use of “simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.”
