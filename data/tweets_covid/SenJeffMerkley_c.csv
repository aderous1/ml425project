254,We cannot allow officers who abuse their badge through racism and brutality to continue do so time and time again. I am working on legislation that would deny DOJ funds to any police department that refuses to report officers fired for misconduct to a national registry.
255,Let’s be crystal clear: Cutting the United States out of the World Health Organization in the middle of the worst global pandemic in a century makes Americans more vulnerable—more Americans will get sick and China will get stronger. https://t.co/Ht91fR4wDX
256,"Trump’s call to shoot protestors is an incitement to murder those who call out injustice.

@realDonaldTrump: How about instead, striving to end injustice? You have the bully pulpit. Use it to build a better nation, not to double-down on racism and abuse."
257,"Initial Covid-19 test: botched

261,Is the Trump administration using the cover of its botched PPP rollout to wage an ideological war on health care providers? Local @PPFA affiliates are exactly the type of community nonprofit providing vital services that Congress intended to support w/ PPP https://t.co/DqZv40W2bs
