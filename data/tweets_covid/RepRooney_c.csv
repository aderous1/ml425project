0,I am a strong believer in the principles of both judicial independence &amp; due process for accused persons in all cases. I have recently read reports about the Uribe case that raise serious questions about whether due process has been followed in the investigation and in his arrest https://t.co/ghXqoLwnMb
1,"On this 19th anniversary of 9/11, we must #NeverForget the thousands of innocent lives we lost on that beautiful day in 2001 and we must continue to honor the brave first responders who saved lives and sacrificed their own. https://t.co/NqZzwCiujb"
2,"This is the wrong move, especially at a time when we are beginning to see Covid cases falling and social distancing/mask wearing working. It is critical for people to be tested if they have come in contact with a Covid positive person. https://t.co/5jgPziMf1M"
3,"Remote voting effectuates social distancing and follows proper health procedures. The work of Congress must continue, but it need not put people at risk unnecessarily. (3/3)"
4,"Votes have been occurring remotely for several months now, with no adverse consequences. Given the recent COVID-19 positive test results for my colleagues, including Louie Gohmert today, this method of voting is the prudent and rational course of action. (2/3)"
5,"Today is #Flagday. Please join me in celebrating our Nation’s Flag, and in honoring those who fought to protect the rights and freedoms that it symbolizes. https://t.co/eFiSzcVwhp"
6,I’m deeply concerned the Ortega regime in #Nicaragua continues to cover up impact of COVID-19 within its borders. I urge full cooperation w/medical experts to mitigate the devastating effects of this virus &amp; support the well-being of the Nicaraguan people https://t.co/GUPO91YAQF
7,"Cong. should utilize all options for conducting business. Proxy/remote voting allows for distancing/following of proper health procedures. We have important work to do over the coming months &amp; it cannot be delayed; however, it isn’t necessary to put people at risk in the process"
8,"The House was right to pass H.Res. 967, to allow for proxy and remote voting on a temporary basis to ensure the safety of its members, staff, &amp; support personnel that work within the Capitol Hill complex. We are still in the midst of a serious, global pandemic. (1/2)"
9,"Congress should get back to work on behalf of the American people when it can be done safely and securely. Right now, remote or paired voting is the best, safest alternative, until the pandemic subsides and normal voting procedures can occur. https://t.co/QMDmLMlZvL"
10,Typical-Maduro regime places 1 of its most corrupt &amp; criminal officials in a critical leadership role as the economy collapses further amid the ongoing health crisis. The int’l community should soundly denounce this action &amp; stand with the Venezuelan people in demanding democracy https://t.co/zck25wUtBc
11,"The WHO, along with most of the UN, is overdue for a cultural overhaul; the United States must protect its interests in these organizations. Are we done with allowing the corrupt CCP to control information to and from the international community? https://t.co/l5N1MBJyPr"
12,"The postal service must adapt to changing markets. In 2019 the USPS lost over $8 billion dollars, so COVID-19 is not the underlying problem for them. The USPS should adjust pricing, eliminate o.t., adjust delivery schedules &amp; eliminate subsidies to compete https://t.co/nNDafbGTd1"
13,"Just as the States had the responsibility for determining the best way to close down activities to deal with COVID-19, they have the responsibility for determining when to reopen. https://t.co/SFwepsfEOF"
14,"Kathleen and I wish a happy and blessed Easter Sunday to all. Especially in these difficult days, we find strength in our faith that we will defeat this deadly virus that plagues our Nation. https://t.co/nE7sHMt5WW"
15,"Like their authoritarian partners around the world, the Cuban regime cannot be counted on as a reliable partner in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/dV48mmkLNP"
16,"Today, @FLDEO announced a new, mobile-friendly online Reemployment Assistance application for new applicants, and Floridians who have previously been unable to begin or complete an application, available at https://t.co/OmTILRzNLZ. Read more here: https://t.co/qtHcF5zWcs"
17,"We’ve updated our website with the latest information on; Individual, Small Business, and Healthcare relief during the Coronavirus pandemic. Continue to visit our site daily for additional updates. https://t.co/M6AVGdwraO"
18,Another example of why #Cuba cannot be trusted in the fight against #COVID19 as it aims to divide for political gain rather than work together with the int'l community to defeat this unprecedented health crisis. https://t.co/6Ug628XHSt
19,"Like its authoritarian partners throughout the world, #Cuba cannot be counted on as a reliable partner in combating the #Coronavirus pandemic https://t.co/RDcun5nasm"

26,We are in a gobal pandemic-Congress should utilize modern technology to permit remote voting. Votes on spending &amp; response to the pandemic are critical &amp; will need quick action. Remote voting is a way to effectuate social distancing &amp; follow proper health procedures #RemoteVote
27,The link below will direct you to a summary of what each federal agency and each individual state is doing to deal with COVID-19. We will continue to provide updates throughout the days and weeks to come. Please share this info with friends and family. https://t.co/cI4oU3vRik
28,"Today I offered an amendment to the PRO Act to empower current union employees who are locked into old and outdated union contracts. In 2016, NLRB data showed that only 6% of union members voted to be represented by their union. (1/2)"
29,I call for the immediate release of Cuban opposition leader @jdanielferrer who remains unlawfully detained for 50 days by the murderous communist regime in Havana #Cuba. @UNPACU #FreeFerrer #SOSFerrer https://t.co/VUBOHQYF2H
30,"I urge the President to reverse his decision of removing our troops, and to send a strong message to #Turkey – along with our other #NATO partners in Europe – that we support the #Kurds who have been fighting with us."
31,Thank you to our @OAS_official partners who voted for sanctions against the oppressive Maduro regime under the #RioTreaty. Pressure that Western Hemisphere nations impose is critical to holding Maduro and his allies accountable for their abuses against the Venezuelan people. https://t.co/p0BW2GL20X

33,"Today marks 6 months since the #BornAliveAct that I cosponsored, which would require that a child born alive after an attempted abortion receive appropriate treatment &amp; be transferred to a hospital, was introduced. It is time to pass this common-sense bill."
34,"I am thankful to the CDC, and Dr. Backer for visiting our community and taking part in our roundtable. The CDC’s involvement is of critical importance to solving long term problems associated with harmful algal blooms, red tide, and other pollution in SWFL. https://t.co/UisreAnbJY"
35,"I commend the Organization of American States for recognizing the legitimacy of Interim Pres. Guaido and his representative to OAS @tarrebriceno. As @USAmbOAS Trujillo stated, now “Venezuela will have a representative who truly represents the Venezuelan people.” @OAS_official"
36,"On 9/11, Islamic terrorists killed 2,996 people on American soil. Rep. Omar referring to this act of terror as ""some people did something"" is offensive to me &amp; to the victims who lost their lives that day, and is just the latest in a series of disturbing comments from this rep."
37,"Today, the President signed an Executive Order requiring asylum seekers to process their claims at ports of entries. This is a much needed action after a decade of abuse by people trying to exploit the system that was meant to protect people with legitimate cases. (2/2)"
38,"I think term limits will bring change, new ideas and prevent the entrenched, elected officials who make it about them and not about the people they represent. https://t.co/Gyv1gQiSss"
