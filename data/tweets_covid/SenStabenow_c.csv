And, the President’s actions do nothing to provide funding to address the immediate worry of parents, teachers, and communities who are struggling with the decisions about re-opening schools."
65,"In addition, he pretends to protect people who are renters. But his executive order doesn’t help a single American family facing eviction right now—he merely directs his own administration to ‘consider,’ to ‘identify,’ to ‘review.’"
66,"So President Trump says that if states want to help their citizens who are currently out of work, they have to lay off workers! That is just a cynical game and just plain cruel."
67,"At the same time, he refuses to provide desperately needed funding for state and local services, jeopardizing the jobs of first responders, health care workers, and others involved in critical essential services for all of us."
68,"Then, instead of just providing federal funding for $400 a week to people who are struggling to survive, he requires states to provide 25% of the funding."

74,Millions of Americans could face eviction during this pandemic because @senatemajldr and Senate Republicans are dragging their feet on extending housing protections. They knew today’s deadline was coming and they chose to ignore it. American families deserve better!

97,It is also critical that low-wage workers who have been required to work as essential workers receive the hazard pay they deserve and that they can finally receive a living wage.
