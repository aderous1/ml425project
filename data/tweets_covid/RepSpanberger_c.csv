149,"Many of the essential deliveries that have enabled families to stay home &amp; stay safe during COVID-19 are actually carried the final few miles by @USPS, because private companies don't see an incentive to deliver to the most remote parts of rural counties like Amelia and Nottoway."
150,"My office has already begun receiving calls from #VA07 constituents whose prescription drugs have been delayed in the mail by Postmaster General DeJoy's attempts to sabotage @USPS. Americans depend on their local Post Office to get medicine, run businesses, and more."
151,"We discussed how their business has responded to the challenges of COVID-19, and what their experience has been as recipients of a PPP loan.

156,"Today, I visited Three Crosses Distilling in Powhatan to learn about how this veteran-owned small business is innovating in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, and to listen to their concerns about relief efforts. I also met with leaders from @vaspirits &amp; @DistilledSpirit. #VA07 https://t.co/A7MYWevmzG"
157,"Destroying these options when #VA07 needs them the most is reckless. It's a slap in the face to our fundamental values of looking out for our neighbors &amp; protecting the vulnerable. I will keep fighting to expand access to affordable healthcare coverage, during COVID-19 &amp; beyond."
158,"Since March, thousands of Virginians have lost their jobs and their employer-sponsored health insurance due to this crisis, at no fault of their own. Many will have to turn to the ACA exchanges to stay covered during the pandemic."

https://t.co/4bUbFavmqa"
162,"Without school or activities, many kids have lost the opportunity to report when they're being abused or exploited. While we continue fighting COVID-19, we MUST account for kids who have fewer &amp; fewer ways to get help. My bill would be a first step. #VA07

167,"During the pandemic, the number of referrals &amp; calls to sexual abuse hotlines has plummeted. The violence hasn't stopped — but it's gotten harder for victims, especially children, to get help. We must redouble our work to rescue kids from these situations. https://t.co/whFXOkERfT"
