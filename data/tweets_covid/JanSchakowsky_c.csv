275,".@ATT has just informed Communications Workers of America their plan to cut 3,400 jobs in the coming months after already cutting 41,000 in the last quarter during #COVID19 when Americans are relying on communication services now more than ever."
276,"In April, @SenWarren @PattyMurray @SenatorBaldwin asked @US_FDA to improve medication abortion access. Right now, patients still can‚Äôt use telehealth for this time-sensitive care. Today, 100+ of my colleagues &amp; I reminded the Trump Admin #AbortionIsEssential during #COVID19 https://t.co/fQg05fE6f6"
277,RT @EnergyCommerce: NEWS: E&amp;C announces a Full Committee hearing with Trump Administration health officials on their response to the #COVID‚Ä¶
278,RT @HouseDemocrats: Make no mistake: Our country‚Äôs long and difficult battle with voter suppression has only been intensified by #COVID19.‚Ä¶
279,"3b. In my opinion, you‚Äôve failed in that role. Why should we now allow you to become director
of @USCPSC, an independent federal agency whose sole mission is public health and consumer safety?"
280,"3a. You have already been offered a role with enormous responsibility during a historic
pandemic. A role in which you decide whether or not public health guidance from our federal
scientific and medical experts ever ‚Äúsee[s] the light of day.‚Äù"
281,"2. What evidence-based reason was there to prevent the release of guidance documents
from @CDCgov, which were eventually released to the media?"
282,"1. Why did you prioritize the politics of the Trump Administration over the public health of
the American people?"
283,"While schools wondered when they could welcome back students, small businesses wondered when
they could reopen their doors, and families wondered how to safely navigate their neighborhoods,
Dr. Beck sat on guidance that @CDCgov had drafted weeks earlier."
284,"When his staff followed up with Dr. Beck at the end of April, she stalled and delayed until @CDCgov
learned that Dr. Beck and the @WhiteHouse decided their guidance would ""never see the light of
day.‚Äù  https://t.co/UkFebmeIEg"
285,"On April 10, @CDCDirector Dr. Redfield asked the @WhiteHouse to approve his agency's thorough,
critical guidance for reopening. Unsurprisingly, he received no answer, as the White House was
more focused on shifting blame and pointing fingers than making a plan."
286,"But even worse, we learned last month that Dr. Beck has already started to undermine consumer
safety and public health through a new role at the @WhiteHouse, serving as the main point of
contact between the Trump Administration and @CDCgov for #COVID19 response guidance."
287,No one should be discriminated against for who they are or who they love. This is a victory for human and civil rights in our nation and a huge step towards true equality for our LGBTQ+ community. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è https://t.co/qSDkBXaZWw

We know the cruelty is the point. But we must keep fighting to #PutPatientsFirst #ProtectTransHealth"
289,"In the midst of the #COVID19 crisis, during a national uprising for racial justice &amp; Black lives, and on the 4th anniversary of #Pulse...

@realDonaldTrump just gave providers &amp; insurers a green light to discriminate against patients at a time when they need health care the most. https://t.co/1ILmlwLW6F"
290,"No one should have to sign away their right to seek legal relief. 

My COVID Justice and Accountability Act would ban forced arbitration during the pandemic and make sure individuals hurt by violations of federal #covid19 laws can have their day in court. https://t.co/BhlSRgosyH"

300,".@realDonaldTrump's veto of the bipartisan CRA means @BetsyDeVosED can move ahead with her agenda of making it harder for defrauded borrowers to get aid. 

The Trump Administration would rather protect predatory schools than students--many of whom are veterans! https://t.co/P1kcirRlDF"
301,Workers are facing the brunt of the #COVID19 crisis in our nation‚Äôs long-term care facilities right alongside residents. That‚Äôs why my Quality Care for Nursing Homes Residents &amp; Workers Act (H.R 6698) would provide 2 weeks of paid sick leave for all staff. https://t.co/VyJDWrS4jw
302,"The same day, @WHO unveiled an initiative to pool #COVID19 knowledge &amp; intellectual property‚Äîputting public health over profits.
 
...Meanwhile, @PhRMA is funding propaganda to protect their U.S. monopoly power and @HHSGov won‚Äôt do anything to stop them. https://t.co/CXMpLnoknr"
303,"Last Friday, @realDonaldTrump terminated our relationship with @WHO, eliminating critical funding and crippling global capacity to prevent and respond to health threats. He has delivered yet another blow to U.S. global leadership and threatened the security of all Americans."
304,The officer who killed George Floyd didn‚Äôt see a man with hopes and dreams. He didn‚Äôt see a human being at all. #GeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter
305,".@TheJusticeDept should bring criminal charges, including murder, against police officers who kill civilians in the line of duty, if the state fails to do so."
306,"When you have police officers who abuse citizens, you erode public confidence in law enforcement. That makes it hard for good police officers to do their job. #GeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter"
307,"During this pandemic, when almost everything has slowed down or stopped, it is evident that racism in America has not. Over the last few months, we have witnessed violence, police brutality and targeted harassment towards African Americans in our country."
308,"Lower drug prices should not be a partisan issue. That's why I‚Äôm proud @RepRooney will be joining me, @RepLloydDoggett, @rosadelauro, and @RepPeterDeFazio to introduce comprehensive legislation to establish protections against #COVID19 drug price gouging. https://t.co/woHbFqIgU8"
309,"Proud to join @RepPressley‚Äôs resolution to condemn police violence and demand accountability from those who use and condone racial profiling, brutality, and excessive force. I will fight to #SaveLivesNow and end the cruel and racist policing that plagues so many communities. https://t.co/EnYm4Zhxfh"
310,"Though the U.S. has spent billions to develop #COVID19 treatments, we have no guarantee these taxpayer-funded drugs will be affordable to all. I just joined @FamiliesUSA March to #EndHighDrugPrices to discuss why we must prevent #COVID19 drug price gouging https://t.co/CFGV6q0i1l"
311,Nearly 40% of our nation‚Äôs #COVID19 deaths are tied to nursing homes. Vulnerable long-term care residents and workers have been crying out for help for months. The Trump Administration‚Äôs inexplicable delay in publishing #COVID19 data from nursing homes is a national disgrace. https://t.co/t4j7UGOo8F
312,"Don‚Äôt forget, @realdonaldtrump cared more about arming our police like soldiers than getting PPE to our frontline health care workers.

https://t.co/kwdUxkgizU"
313,"The Trump Admin has touted their work to increase access to telehealth &amp; prevent trips to the doctor during #COVID19‚Äîbut when it comes to critical abortion &amp; miscarriage care, they insist on enforcing an antiquated restriction that jeopardizes patient safety. 

Unacceptable. https://t.co/SReLRBjQL5"

All students 3-17 &amp; 18-22 (if in high school) are eligible for P-EBT, meaning they can receive SNAP benefits.

315,We need meaningful police reform now. Holding officers accountable is only the first step. We must also ensure those who abuse and kill cannot be rehired in another jurisdiction. https://t.co/OaowsGIybP
316,The whole world has now seen the murder of George Floyd. The officers involved should be arrested and charged to the fullest extent of the law.
317,"100,000 deaths in the U.S.

5,000+ in Illinois. 

We‚Äòve lost nearly 900 Americans each day since February 6, when our first known #COVID19 fatality was recorded.

They were our friends, our family, our physicians, our nursing home staff, our mail carriers. They were all of us."
318,Proud to join 160+ of my colleagues in writing this letter to @SBAgov and @USTreasury urging them to prioritize public health over politics and ideology in administering the Paycheck Protection Program. We need the safety-net care @PPFA health centers provide now more than ever. https://t.co/HmoXZl9tW6
319,"Just 9 years ago the @HouseGOP celebrated regaining the majority by reading the Constitution. Look at them now! Totally captured by, ironically, a Twitter troll President who has shown nothing but contempt for the Constitution. https://t.co/5ZiiHA64Bw"
320,This dangerous effort from the powerful nursing home industry‚Äîthat has unfortunately already been successful in 20 states‚Äîis a key example of why we must pass the #COVID19 Justice and Accountability Act to protect residents and workers as soon as possible. https://t.co/cGJp48vIau
321,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr are tripping over each other rushing to give corporations blanket immunity from COVID-19 related litigation. Today I introduced the COVID Justice and Accountability Act with @RepMarkTakano &amp; @RepChuyGarcia to protect Americans‚Äô right to action

323,"#HeroesAct would mandate that long-term care facilities report demographic-specific #COVID19 data, including race &amp; ethnicity. 

It is shameful that the only information we currently have to respond to this crisis has been compiled by journalists &amp; not the federal government."
324,Long-term care facilities with a high number of Black &amp; Latino residents have been 2x more likely to be devastated by #coronavirus than other facilities. Racial disparities in #COVID19 are everywhere. The Trump Admin isn‚Äôt doing enough to address them. https://t.co/WIaaIousvF

336,"But instead, right-wing politicians are engaging in a clear political attack on Planned Parenthood health centers and trying to limit access to health care for my constituents and all Americans. This has absolutely nothing to do with eligibility for #COVID19 economic relief."
337,"We should all be proud that the PPP loans we passed through Congress have ensured these health centers can retain staff and continue to provide patients with essential health care, including time-sensitive sexual and reproductive health care, during the #COVID19 pandemic."
338,"Local @PPFA health centers are the only source of health care for many patients‚Äîparticularly in underserved communities that have been hit hardest by #COVID19. They are a key part of our social safety net, ‚Äã‚Äãlike all other nonprofits &amp; providers serving Americans in this crisis."

344,This is yet another reason why the Senate must pass our #HeroesAct as soon as possible.
