0,To every person who is worried about what your future looks like under this SCOTUS: I’ll never stop fighting for you. Breaking the rules/norms to appoint activist judges who legislate from the bench is undemocratic &amp; unacceptable. Keep on standing up &amp; speaking out.
1,Families with sick children are scared they won’t be able to pay for their health care if the Affordable Care Act is struck down. Women are scared the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade &amp; punish them for their decisions about when &amp; whether to have children.
2,"There is a clear &amp; present danger of a humanitarian, moral, &amp; constitutional crisis, as the Supreme Court shifts radically to the right &amp; prepares to strike down laws vital to health &amp; American values. Americans across the country are scared &amp; saddened tonight."
3,"Here’s #WhatsAtStake for Kristen if Judge Barrett is confirmed: “The ACA has been a lifesaver for me… It is unthinkable that anyone would try to get rid of the ACA, especially during a pandemic. I fear that if the ACA is struck down, I will no longer be able to have insurance…"" https://t.co/LGzCOohwNc"
4,"When you take away a woman's reproductive freedoms, when you turn women who seek to have a choice about starting a family into criminals, when you make doctors who help them guilty of crimes, you don't end abortion. You make getting an abortion more dangerous."
5,"We simply can’t go back to a time when politicians &amp; Supreme Court justices controlled a person’s decision about whether &amp; when to have a child.

America can’t go back. The right to safe, legal reproductive health care is in jeopardy with Barrett’s nomination. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/M6iDge5o0U"
6,"Shameful surrender—as Trump’s COS says no control over COVID is possible &amp; infection rates skyrocket. All blame, no action, is a formula for lethal leadership failure. Testing, mask wearing, &amp; other commonsense measures are key to control this pandemic. https://t.co/cO3POsCREV"
7,Confirming Amy Coney Barrett—who  actively opposes the ACA—would be devastating for millions of Americans. Just ask my constituents who would face real harm in real ways if the Supreme Court guts the ACA. https://t.co/Vprmn8Ztnn
8,"For Orlando, Rey &amp; their family so much is on the line w/this nomination. Barrett refused to say Lawrence v Texas (overturned sodomy laws) or Obergefell v Hodges (marriage equality) were correctly decided—making it likely she'll vote to overturn cases that establish love is love. https://t.co/vPLhORQCJp"
9,"Instead of imperiling health care &amp; other fundamental rights by installing a radical, activist justice to the Supreme Court, the Senate should be voting on measures that have already passed the House &amp; would actually address the needs &amp; challenges of the American people. https://t.co/Br3LoxnTln"
10,Open enrollment for health insurance is almost here. Starting on October 26th people can start window shopping for Access Health CT (https://t.co/9I4aP45jdy) plans before enrollment or re-enrollment begins on November 1st. https://t.co/3D2asxXBJE
11,"My Democratic colleagues &amp; I stand united. 

Rights to health care

Rights to gun violence prevention

Rights to vote

 Rights to safety in the workplace

Rights to reproductive freedoms

These fundamental rights may be gutted with Judge Barrett seated on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/osVsB9zOuS"
12,I won’t legitimize this sham process that ignores the voices of millions of Americans who are currently casting their ballots. The next president &amp; the next Senate should decide who is the next Supreme Court justice. The will of the American people must be heard.
13,In my Judiciary Committee seat today is Conner—a boy whose life-limiting illness makes the ACA a lifesaver. We must take a stand against Republicans’ rush to shatter norms &amp; ignore the real-life impact Barrett will have on the ACA &amp; so much more. https://t.co/vBfSats1yU
14,"Hundreds of children orphaned because of Trump &amp; his Admin’s brazen, premeditated cruelty—or as they heinously think of it “political strategy.” All who are a part of these horrid human rights abuses must answer for their actions.  https://t.co/l2pRTM87Mc"
15,"The criminality of murder, the existence of climate change/pollution, &amp; the easy steps to inhibit the spread of COVID-19 should not be controversial. For Amy Coney Barrett these issues are—presenting terrifying consequences for the Supreme Court &amp; the American people. https://t.co/2XkzykcCXw"
16,"To my written questions, Judge Barrett wouldn’t say murder is a federal crime.

Judge Barrett wouldn’t acknowledge climate change.

Judge Barrett wouldn’t say gasoline burning cars emit pollution.

Judge Barrett wouldn’t agree on the importance of masks &amp; physical distancing. https://t.co/afsDNTOwH1"
17,"What we are seeing with these 4 dissenters, are justices taking brazen political action. This deeply dangerous trend on election law could destroy the credibility &amp; legitimacy of the Supreme Court, whose power depends on the trust &amp; faith of the American people."
18,"Jessica, Chris, Mike, Kristin, Janet, Julia, &amp; Gaye, thank you for allowing me to share your stories in last week's hearings &amp; standing with me today. Your courage &amp; conviction are the inspiration for so many of us who are fighting against the rushed nomination of Judge Barrett. https://t.co/DHfOOwWK9L"

22,"Suicide is a gun violence problem. Vic has become an advocate for extreme risk protection order laws, which give law enforcement the tools to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others. With Barrett’s nomination, these laws are now at risk. https://t.co/29w3U3kqLB"
23,"""I’ve been able to stay on my parents’ health insurance until 26, none of my diseases precluded me from obtaining insurance... &amp; I’ve been able to enroll in an expanded Medicaid program... With the possible elimination of the ACA, that all comes into question &amp; I'm terrified.” https://t.co/oqunFVopIm"
24,"Barrett said she disagrees w/SCOTUS' second decision to uphold the ACA.

For people like Kristen &amp; Campbell their health care &amp; lives are on the line w/this nomination.

Kristen: “I live w/type 1 diabetes, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis &amp; Sjogren’s Syndrome..."
25,"Again, I’m asking Amy Coney Barrett crucial questions about how she would approach a lifetime appointment to our highest court &amp; sharing with her stories from my constituents who know #WhatsAtStake with this nomination. https://t.co/JvzLPhwCkn"
26,"Roe v Wade gave Samantha a choice. After becoming pregnant as a result of being raped, she was able to access health care that gave her the agency to make decisions about whether&amp;when to have a child. https://t.co/h5UPetQ5Jp"
27,Christine was diagnosed with a thyroid condition that was only discovered after she could access coverage on CT’s health care exchange. Repealing the ACA would cut her off from affordable insurance &amp; medications. https://t.co/khZq9gd07J
28,"After being diagnosed with a brain tumor, being eligible for coverage under CT’s ACA Medicaid expansion program was “a godsend” for Julia. With a nominee like Barrett on the docket, she is “absolutely terrified of what’s going to happen” to her health care. https://t.co/BZYCaNEhoq"
29,"I recently spoke w/Tracy who told me she was scared when she saw that the St. Joseph County Right to Life, the group whose ad Barrett supported, stated, “We would be supportive of criminalizing the discarding of frozen embryos or selective reduction through the IVF process.” 1/3 https://t.co/C2sbqrA0CG"

36,"Before the ACA, insurers would not cover Stuart because they considered his knee issues a pre-existing condition. Once the ACA was law, he was able to get health coverage, two knee replacements&amp;later, treatment for bone marrow cancer. Stuart said he owes his life to the ACA. 3/4 https://t.co/5lKEe5lIq3"
37,"Emily is a former professional figure skater &amp; triathlete who has had osteoporosis since age 40. At age 62, a doctor told her that her bones were crumbling.

38,"For Conner, &amp; millions of others whose lives depend on the ACA, Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination is terrifying. Putting her on the Supreme Court would allow Republicans to strike down in court what they cannot repeal in Congress."
39,"The costs of Conner’s care are astronomical. Conner is a super hero, but he’s always had a sidekick—the Affordable Care Act. It has shielded him &amp; his family—giving them relief, hope, &amp; peace of mind. They still worry about Conner’s health, but not their coverage or its costs. https://t.co/Ai6Xhz1v4Y"

44,"The COVID-19 pandemic has painfully illuminated these disparities, taking a tragic toll on underserved communities. The Health Equity &amp; Accountability Act will broaden access to health care, improves language services/cultural trainings, &amp; increases workforce diversity."
45,"This bill is a bold blueprint for tackling the immense inequities in our health care system. Far too many Americans are unable to access quality health care because of the color of their skin, who they love, where they live, or how much money they have. https://t.co/vbOqYhVCVd"

54,"Dismissively downplaying the need for commonsense public health protections is an incredibly irresponsible, inadequate response. Failure to take COVID seriously—wearing masks, getting tested, &amp; following safety measures—will cause more death, suffering, &amp; loss."
55,"210K+ are dead, but this president—who is receiving world class taxpayer health care unavailable to most—is saying “Don’t be afraid of Covid.” That’s deeply insulting &amp; painful to those who've lost a loved one, are currently suffering from COVID, &amp; are following CDC guidance."

If this disease can reach the White House, it can infect anyone in any house. Please remember to wear masks, physically distance, &amp; follow other public health guidelines."
62,Thank you to the brave athletes &amp; survivors who have spoken truth to power. Without their courage &amp; conviction this bill would not have gotten across the finish line.
63,"With Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, the shredding of reproductive rights &amp; women’s health care is practically a given. The ramifications: immense, sweeping real-life consequences for millions of Americans."
