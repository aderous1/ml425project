129,Local officials and victim advocates joined me today in the Lehigh Valley to call for passage of my bipartisan Combat Online Predators Act.

131,"Learn more about my bipartisan efforts to curb the opioid epidemic, like the Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act I introduced with @SenDougJones here: https://t.co/c34b1SEZ3C"
132,"From keeping deadly fentanyl out of the U.S., to passing the Comprehensive Abuse and Recovery Act, Congress has shown that the opioid epidemic isn't a partisan issue. @POTUS has been a strong partner in this fight. I appreciated his remarks today about ending this epidemic."
133,"This #Easter, my family and I join Christians around the world in celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Wishing all of those across our commonwealth who celebrate a very blessed #Easter! https://t.co/FVxAqzqkQS"
134,"Felons don't have a right to own a gun, and felons who lie on background checks are committing a new felony. It's imperative that we go after those who #LieAndTry to illegally purchase guns. See more about my bipartisan legislation here: https://t.co/aeTd54aXVZ"
135,Felons who lie about their criminal history in order to buy a gun have just committed a new felony. These crimes largely go unprosecuted. Read about my work to enforce existing laws against those who #LieAndTry on background checks in @TribLIVE: https://t.co/ps5A86Iwcx
136,I'm working w/@SenBobCasey &amp; @RepBrianFitz to protect children from stalking by online predators. Our bipartisan Combat Online Predators Act will strengthen penalties on those who prey upon children. I am hopeful Congress will soon pass our legislation. https://t.co/epPuMHjnTB
137,Pressure from @POTUS and the attention shown by Congress to this epidemic were critical in getting Beijing to act. I am pleased China is taking additional steps to control this deadly substance by subjecting all fentanyl-like chemicals to its drug laws. https://t.co/zGLD0cknCc
138,#VietnamVeteransDay is a time for us to give thanks to the brave American veterans who served in Vietnam. These individuals and their families made tremendous sacrifices to keep us safe.

143,"A bipartisan majority voted tonight to ensure care is given to infants who survive botched abortions. Sadly, a minority of senators justified blocking the bill by saying it limits access to abortions, which isn’t true. It's about babies, who are born alive, &amp; deserve protection."
144,"Currently there aren’t federal protections for infants who survive botched abortions. My &amp; @SenSasse's bill ensures living, breathing babies who survive botched abortions get the same medical care as any other child. Read our op-ed in @GoErie about this: https://t.co/ng0BrvWoT3"

146,"#ValentinesDay is the sweetest holiday there is. What's not sweet is the U.S. sugar program, which forces Americans to pay 2X more for sugar than the rest of the world. It's bad for consumers &amp; the 40,000 Pennsylvanians who work in sugar-using industries. We need reforms now. https://t.co/pOOXkJyTIl"

213,"We are pleased that AG Sessions is directing all U.S. Attorneys to more vigorously enforce existing gun laws against individuals who are legally barred from owning a gun but “lie and try” to buy one. Unfortunately, federal prosecutors rarely pursue these cases."
214,Thank you to everyone who joined me today for my telephone town hall. I greatly appreciated your questions and hearing about what issues matter to you. https://t.co/P9YeqSO8If
215,Our NICS Denial Notification Act requires @FBI to notify states within 24 hours when a person who is prohibited from getting a gun lies about their background in an attempt to buy one. That’s a federal felony &amp; it goes almost entirely unprosecuted now.
216,".@ChrisCoons, @MarcoRubio, @SenBillNelson, &amp; I are introducing a bill that gives state law enforcement critical info so they can better enforce existing gun laws against those who lie &amp; try to purchase a gun but legally shouldn't own them."
217,This important bipartisan legislation advances our shared goal of keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them while safeguarding the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. I hope the Senate will pass this #NoFlyNoBuy bill soon. https://t.co/xvDNXXNvpz

219,"Thank you @chucktodd for having me on this morning. ICYMI, watch my segment on @MeetThePress. We discussed my and @Sen_JoeManchin's bill to tighten background checks to ensure those who shouldn't have guns can't get them. Watch: https://t.co/F1uezP2WHK"
220,I'll be joining @ChuckTodd on @MeetThePress this morning to discuss ways we can prevent guns from falling into the hands of those who shouldn't have them. Check your local @NBC listings to watch.
221,"@realDonaldTrump Look forward to talking with you soon, Mr. President, about my proposal with @Sen_JoeManchin to strengthen federal background checks to keep firearms away from those who shouldn’t have them."
222,"I voted in favor of legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for individuals who were brought to the United States illegally at a young age and address other critical challenges within our broken immigration system, including border security and enforcement."
223,"I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them--criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, and terrorists."
224,"In order for any #DACA fix to be meaningful and effective, we can't tie the hands of those who try to enforce the laws we write. #SanctuaryCity policies make it virtually impossible for any #DACA fix to be implemented in good faith. Worse still, they make us less safe."
225,Immigrants want safe cities and communities as much as anyone. My amendment allows cities to protect illegal immigrants who come forward as witnesses or victims of crimes. This is about everyone’s safety.
226,"Immigrants want safe streets, too, and the bill has language to protect those here illegally who come forward as a victim or witness of a crime."
227,This isn’t about asking local police to enforce fed. immigration law. Fed. immigration officials are merely asking police to hold a person – who’s already been arrested and is in the US illegally – until DHS/ICE can arrive to question or take custody.
228,"For example: Philly PD once arrested an illegal immigrant, who’d previously been deported, for assault &amp; other charges. Fed. immigration officials asked Philly PD to hold him temporarily. Instead, the man was set free. He was later arrested for raping a child under the age of 13."
229,"#SanctuaryCities are jurisdictions/municipalities, like Philly, that have policies barring local law enf. from cooperating with fed. immigration authorities in certain instances, even in cases when they wanted to help. These policies hamper law enf. &amp; make us less safe."
230,"Combating opioid abuse, improving veterans’ health care, and boosting funding for national security and our military are worthy priorities President Trump’s budget proposal embraces. I look forward to reviewing this budget proposal in its entirety over the coming week."
231,"While I was not among those on the train this morning, I am nevertheless grateful for the first responders who moved swiftly to help. I'm praying for those who were injured in this accident."
