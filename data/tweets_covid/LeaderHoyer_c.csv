0,"Other countries were successful in controlling this virus and curtailing its dangerous impact. Under the Trump Administration, the United States has lost nearly 230,000 lives. Mark Meadows is right: they aren’t controlling this pandemic, they have surrendered to it. https://t.co/0yLTvSQjbk"
1,Trump’s downplaying of this virus is not consistent with the record-breaking cases and hospitalizations we’ve seen in the last few days. He puts American lives at stake with his recklessness and the American people deserve better.  https://t.co/cgHikW6nhF
2,Trump has grossly mismanaged this crisis. We are not “rounding the corner” on this pandemic if there are still 23 million Americans waiting to get back to work. We must reach agreement on COVID-19 relief in order to defeat this virus and address its economic impact.
3,"Congress must provide funding for state &amp; local governments to help keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, &amp; other critical workers on the payroll as they confront budget shortfalls. Any COVID-19 relief deal must make this issue a priority. https://t.co/ywgwxuBMao"
4,The uptick in violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic is unacceptable. Our Delegation worked hard to secure funds to help ensure survivors &amp; those experiencing domestic violence have the resources they need to recover and rebuild their lives. https://t.co/6GaVbUfwId
5,"Wishing a happy birthday to my friend @RepLoriTrahan, a proud member for all in #MA03. I thank her for her efforts on @EdLaborCmte fighting for educators and students in Massachusetts during this pandemic, and for our veterans on @HASCDemocrats."
6,"Hospitalizations from COVID-19 are spiking around the country, threatening the capacity of care providers to treat patients. Instead of working to defeat this virus, Trump ignores this devastating reality and says we are rounding the corner. Shameful. https://t.co/RWt4jQyUb0"
7,Losing the knowledge and experience of these civil servants would be deeply harmful to our country. House Democrats will continue to stand up for federal workers who do so much for our nation.
8,The President’s executive order against our country’s civil service is a dangerous betrayal of our federal workers. I strongly oppose this; I will continue to fight for all of the federal workers in my district who proudly serve this country. https://t.co/WCVyNWyC3N
9,"This weekend the US saw a record number of COVID-19 cases 2 days in a row. This is not what rounding the corner looks like. We must reach agreement on COVID relief, and I urge all Americans to wear masks, social distance, &amp; listen to public health experts. https://t.co/bx74VSXWTL"
10,"On health care, voters face an easy choice. There is a clear difference between Democrats safeguarding and strengthening Americans’ health care while Republicans work to kick millions off of their coverage. Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/z8G1jq2eYW"
11,"Pleased our Delegation helped secure almost $800,000 to expand housing-related counseling services throughout MD. The economic crisis caused by COVID-19 has created a significant strain for many, and funding will help families get back on their feet. https://t.co/DtaVZ6lbmg"
12,"The CBOC will expand the availability of health care &amp; mental health services, &amp; provide dental care, women’s health care, &amp; physical therapy services. I’ve worked to bring a new facility to Charlotte Hall for over 10 years, &amp; I’m so glad to see this project brought to fruition."
13,"Americans heard directly from Trump that he hopes the #ACA will be struck down by SCOTUS. For 4 years, Trump has failed to deliver the health care plan he promised. Now, during a pandemic, his true plan is clear: to kick millions off their coverage. https://t.co/7i9o8eguT8"
14,"The American people have been waiting ""weeks"" for Trump’s health care plan for the last 4 years, but he never had a plan – other than to kick people off coverage. Today he said it would be ""good"" for the #ACA to be struck down by the Supreme Court. Take a look: https://t.co/9A5OZDN4lm"
15,"Today’s executive order from @POTUS undermining the federal workforce is yet another in a long list of actions taken by this Admin to betray the hardworking, dedicated, and patriotic Americans who have chosen to work on behalf of their fellow citizens. https://t.co/KDsSvSKwu1"
16,COVID-19 poses a serious threat to the economic gains made by women. House Dems’ #HeroesAct would help the countless working mothers and families who are struggling through this crisis &amp; I continue to call on the Senate to get serious about providing this relief. #momsbailout
17,"This process has devolved into a shameless gambit by Republicans to stack the court against Americans’ access to affordable health care, against their own rules, &amp; against democratic norms. I urge them to stop this charade &amp; wait until after the election to consider any nominee."
18,"Just days after the election, the Supreme Court will be hearing arguments in a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act and threaten health care access for those with pre-existing conditions."
19,"It was a step forward for SARS to be disbanded, but I am deeply concerned about the continuing and horrific police violence against peaceful protesters. I stand with the people of Nigeria who demand justice and accountability."
20,"For more than 5 months, Republicans have refused to take action to help families struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats will continue to fight to meet the needs of Americans and deliver relief to those who need it most. https://t.co/6axjMogDxc"
21,"During an economic and public health crisis, @SenateMajLdr would rather confirm judges than pass desperately-needed coronavirus relief to help millions of American families and businesses. American lives are at stake, and Republicans are failing our nation. https://t.co/SglRdDGaZ5"
22,"The bill brought to the Senate Floor today is yet another example of Republicans’ refusal to take this pandemic seriously. It shows that Senate Republicans have no interest in providing relief to the American people, who so desperately need it. https://t.co/SJIYXepS9V"
23,Health disparities among the Latino community in our state have exacerbated the impact of COVID-19. I joined with my colleagues in urging @GovLarryHogan to deliver targeted relief to Latino families &amp; focus on halting the spread of the virus. https://t.co/dWBZjtPjC5
24,"The disaster during this pandemic has been the President’s shameful mismanagement of this virus that has cost over 220,000 American lives, not Dr. Fauci. The President’s continuing attacks on science and scientific experts is disgraceful. https://t.co/dOBDrKObBl"
25,"I spoke with the @WashingtonPost’s @Rho_Co today on coronavirus negotiations. Americans need us to deliver additional relief, but Trump and Senate GOP remain very far apart. We must reach agreement swiftly to help those who desperately need it. https://t.co/Xrr6Yza1QU"
26,"I was on @MeetThePress with @ChuckTodd today to discuss COVID-relief negotiations. The GOP is divided on providing more relief, but Americans need help now. If Trump is serious about assistance to Americans, he ought to convince the GOP to reach an agreement now. https://t.co/PS16jtYmhd"
27,Thousands of families are at risk of losing their homes in January if an agreement isn’t reached to provide additional relief. Democrats provided relief to renters &amp; homeowners in the #HeroesAct &amp; the next COVID-19 bill must also include this assistance. https://t.co/KCkYEQRxht
28,Our nation’s day care centers are an essential service for parents who must work during this time and their children. House Dems have acted to provide relief to the child care industry and prevent a crisis; I call on the GOP Senate to work with us. https://t.co/DlMq07YUpn
29,Millions are suffering from the economic impact of COVID-19 &amp; hunger has risen in the US. House Democrats have continued to fight for an increase in SNAP assistance by passing the #HeroesAct. We must reach agreement on coronavirus relief to help address this critical need.
30,Sunday’s court ruling to block the Trump Admin from kicking unemployed workers off of SNAP benefits is a massive victory for so many households struggling with food insecurity during this pandemic. https://t.co/KEErHGP2Dw
31,Yesterday I spoke with @AxiosReCap to discuss the urgent need for additional COVID-19 relief for the millions of American families and businesses struggling during this pandemic. Listen here: https://t.co/900nszVF3w
32,"Nearly 900K new unemployment claims were filed last week, continuing the unacceptably high numbers of Americans needing assistance, but Republicans say “you’re on your own.” The time to act is now; we must reach agreement on a coronavirus relief bill."
33,"Had the Trump Administration listened to science and experts in the beginning, America’s COVID-19 death rate could have been lower. Too many Americans are suffering. We can work together to slow the spread by wearing masks and social distancing. https://t.co/1erRH4z3V2"
34,Too many families are grieving that wouldn’t be if the Trump Administration showed the leadership needed to defeat this virus. Trump has abandoned the American people and his inaction will cause more tragedy. https://t.co/tIoR1e04EI
35,"If the U.S. had the same death rate as Canada, less lives would have been lost to this pandemic. Instead, the Trump Administration’s mismanagement of this crisis has cost over 210,000 lives. https://t.co/MKj6fX59SW"
36,The WH decision to ignore CDC guidelines on wearing face coverings on public transit puts millions of Americans at risk. We know wearing masks can save lives. The Administration continues to show a complete lack of leadership needed to defeat this virus. https://t.co/ijOBFTHtCn
37,Families continue to struggle due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. GOP &amp; @POTUS should put the needs of Americans first &amp; work with Dems to reach agreement. I joined @MSNBC's Morning Joe to discuss the immediate need for additional COVID-19 relief. https://t.co/uLXa7i5rYn
38,"Iran continues to unlawfully detain American citizen Siamak Namazi during the Covid-19 pandemic despite the highly dangerous conditions in Evin Prison. Today marks 5 years of captivity. He and his ailing father, Baquer Namazi, must be allowed to return to the US."
39,"Trump’s dangerous decision to walk away from negotiations on a COVID-19 relief bill has placed our economy and millions of Americans at risk. He has abandoned the American people, leaving them to confront this pandemic on their own. https://t.co/n79MYYs4DV"
40,"Democrats worked in good faith last week and put forward a comprehensive bill to provide Americans with the urgent relief they need to get through this pandemic. Instead of working with us, Donald Trump walked away. https://t.co/rIKfJ6hbOW"
41,"Economists agree that Americans and our economy benefited from the weekly $600 UI passed in CARES, and that state &amp; local governments need help now – that’s why it is so irresponsible for the GOP to abandon American families who need economic relief. https://t.co/Z8jnmj1qaP"
42,"Unemployment claims from last week remain historically high with 1 in 6 workers seeking assistance. Instead of providing urgent relief, the GOP have walked away from negotiations on a COVID-19 relief bill, abandoning the millions of Americans who are waiting to get back to work."
43,"Happy birthday to my friend @RepBillFoster, proud Member for #IL11. As the only PhD physicist in Congress, we value your commitment to science &amp; your work to defeat this virus in your role on @COVIDOversight. I also thank you for your service on @HouseScience and @FSCDems."
44,"Wishing my friend from the great State of Texas @RepLloydDoggett a happy birthday today. Thank you for your critical work as Chair of @WaysMeansCmte Subcommittee on Health, especially during this pandemic, and fighting to defend the #ACA for millions of Americans."
45,It is shameful that Republicans and President Trump are abandoning the American people by refusing to work on COVID-19 relief legislation.
46,"Republicans are abandoning the people to face the challenge of this pandemic and a severe economic downturn on their own. Democrats, however, will continue to fight for the help that the American people need."
47,"This week is #MIAW2020, and I join with all those who are working to end the stigma around mental illness.

59,The pandemic's economic toll is devastating; it's unacceptable that Americans are forced to choose between keeping the lights on &amp; putting food on the table. Dems are taking action tonight to provide relief; Trump &amp; GOP should work w/us to reach agreement. https://t.co/kfeBVyGHJx

66,Trump criticized the amount Obama paid in taxes – but it turns out Trump paid NOTHING in federal taxes 10 of the last 15 years. He’s a liar who conned the American people. https://t.co/mTC6sXtvjB
67,Trump &amp; the GOP have failed to deliver a comprehensive health care plan #ForThePeople; their only plan is to end the #ACA – taking health care away &amp; ending protections for millions w/ pre-ex conditions – and now they’re trying to jam a SCOTUS nominee through in order to do it. https://t.co/igeK6BdbEp
68,"The contrast in our priorities is clear: Democrats have worked since day one to lower health care costs and ensure access to affordable, quality health care #ForThePeople while Republicans have worked to take health coverage away from Americans – even in the middle of a pandemic. https://t.co/36yFlL26rl"
69,"I said that Democrats have delivered #ForThePeople by passing bills to lower the cost of health care, rebuild our economy, &amp; clean up corruption while Republicans stopped legislating years ago to focus only on stacking the courts – which they’re now using to strike down the #ACA."
70,"I also said that Joe Biden showed his empathy, decency &amp; strength during last night’s debate while the President showed that he is a divisive figure who rationalizes white supremacy and continues to demonstrate his unworthiness to be President of the United States."

95,The uptick in unemployment claims reflects more suffering &amp; pain from the economic fallout resulting from GOP failure to address the pandemic. It also shows that the GOP argument against additional $600 in assistance is meritless. The GOP needs to get serious &amp; take real action.
