271,"According to the VA’s own data, the Central AL VA continues to be a terrible VA health care system. I am sick &amp; tired of getting status quo answers as to why. This is a huge disservice to our veterans, &amp; I will not stop making the case to Secretary Wilkie until we get this right."

287,"Appalling. I can't fathom how any person could oppose protecting living, breathing infants born despite attempted abortion. Dems can call it a matter of ""women's health,"" but I'm calling it what it is: Infanticide. And Americans deserve to know where each of us stands on it. https://t.co/G365RJGC4J"
